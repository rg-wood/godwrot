        <h2>Introduction: The Land</h2>

        <div class="columns">

          <p><em>Black Griffon</em> takes place in The Land: a vast, continental mass that is going through a renaissance-like period. The Land is still largely medieval: most of humanity huddles together in villages and towns separated by vast tracts of untamed wilderness.</p>

          <p>Yet, in the midst of this great darkness, a few bastions of civilisation shine, beacons of hope. In the cities, abbeys and courts of men, philosophers, merchants and nobles gather together to discuss new ideas. Ideas that threaten to overturn the old orders and usher in a new age of enlightenment.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Age of War.</strong></em> For many, however, this brave, new age bears a striking resemblance to old ones. New ideas threaten old powers and embolden new ones. The inevitable result is familiar to many: war!</p>

          <p>Religious schisms, new, national borders and old, ethnic tensions divide the people anew. Brother takes arms against brother in cruel battle, made all the worse by new discoveries in explosives and firearms.</p>

          <p>In the midst of this chaos, corruption thrives. While the old authorities are distracted, thieves band together, corrupt officials take bribes and hypocrites and demagogues prosper.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Magic Dwindles.</strong></em> As reason waxes, the Old Ways wane. The gods no longer intervene directly in the affairs of men. The fey, once abundant, are rarely seen as they retreat deeper into their woods and caves.</p>

          <p>As magic fades, superstition takes root. Ruthless inquisitors hunt down the last, few practitioners. Witches and magi alike go into hiding as their brethren are put to the torch. Magical traditions that lasted centuries, from master to apprentice, are broken, their lore lost forever. Circles and covens are smashed, their ancient practices spread to the winds.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Intrigue and Conspiracy.</strong></em> For most, the chaos of this age seems meaningless. Some, however, sense a deeper pattern. A hidden meaning in the disorder, a secret history of past events, circles within circles. Networks of spies criss-cross the land, trading information for gold or blood. Hidden cults swear faith to forgotten gods in exchange for power. And cabals of mystics band together for protection and to consolidate their power.</p>

          <h3>The Gods, Old and New</h3>

          <p>While the gods remain silent their faithful are anything but. The Land is filled with acolytes, priests and zealots. They stand on city streets scolding the masses, or wander lonely roads looking for converts.</p>

          <p>The faiths are counted as follows:</p>

          <p><em><strong>The Holy Church of The Father and The Mother.</strong></em> The Father and The Mother are the true gods of men. The Church is their all-powerful instrument, a massive institution that crosses national boundaries and has its fingers in nearly every aspect of common life. No other faiths are tolerated, and even kings must bend their knee to the Hierophant.</p>

          <p>Yet the Church is far from united, and even its inquisitors cannot stamp out all heresy. Apostates frequently find loopholes in Church law or escape the authorities. And in abbeys, nunneries and cathedrals, scholarly monks and priestesses explore new, enlightened ways to celebrate their faith.</p>

          <p><em><strong>The Old Ways.</strong></em> Once, mankind trembled at the feet of leviathans. Giants, great serpents, dragons: The Old Gods. Fortunately, their age has long passed and only their servants, the fey, survive.</p>

          <p>Despite the best efforts of the witch hunters, the Old Ways still linger. Ancient superstitions exist side-by-side with faithful worship. Even the most devout villager will still visit the old woman in the woods to cure their pox. And, in the darkest parts of the woods, the ancient druid circles still gather to howl at the night sky.</p>

          <p><em><strong>The Bastard</strong></em>. The dark god of trickery and luck (both good and bad). It is whispered that he is the illegitimate child of The Father and... something else. Just admitting the existence of The Bastard is technically heresy. However, worship amongst outcasts and thieves is an open secret. You'll often hear folk cursing his name when they stub their toe or lose a bet.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Hell.</strong></em> There is no doubt in the minds of the common folk that hell exists. What troubles the priesthood is this: if the gods are absent, what of hell? Are the forces of evil absent too? Or are they merely hiding in the shadows?</p>

        <h2 id="characters">Black Griffin Characters</h2>

        <div class='columns'>

          <p>You start the campaign as mercenaries in the employ of the infamous Company of the Black Griffin. Lowly even for sellswords, you have been placed on punishment duty as <em>company fetches</em>: bounty hunters charged with capture of deserters for trial.</p>

          <p>With this in mind, when you create your characters you are:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Renaissance Men and Women</strong>. You live in a period analogous to the early Renaissance. Magic is waning and strange new ideas spread, causing war and upending the old orders in their wake. You may be trained in the use of <em>firearms</em> (see below).</li>
            <li><strong>Mercenaries</strong>. You start with Renown 1 in the <em>Company of the Black Griffon</em> faction (see page 6). Remember to note the faction perks on your character sheet.</li>
            <li><strong>Low-magic</strong>. You are limited to <em>low-magic</em> character options unless you pick a <em>unique background</em> (see below).</li>
          </ol>

          <div class="aside">
            <h4>Factions</h4>

            <p>Black Griffon is a campaign of intrigue and conspiracies. With this in mind, it makes heavy use of the rules for factions in chapter 1 of the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em>.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Low-Magic Characters</h3>

          <p>Normally, low-magic characters are limited to playing humans and choosing from the following classes:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Path of Berserker Barbarian</li>
            <li>Battle Master <em>or</em> Champion Fighter</li>
            <li>Thief <em>or</em> Assassin Rogue</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="aside">
            <h4>Low-Magic Feats</h4>

            <p>If you're using the optional rules for feats from the <em>Player's Handbook</em>, you may <em>not</em> choose the following feats:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Lucky</li>
              <li>Mage Slayer</li>
              <li>Magical Initiate</li>
              <li>Ritual Caster</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h4>Unique Backgrounds</h4>

          <p>If you want to play a magical character you can select a unique background at the start of character creation, instead of a normal background. A unique background represents a rare or special origin that might give your character access to magical races or classes (or feats) in a way that is sympathetic to low-magic campaigns.</p>

          <p>Each unique background lists which magical races, classes and feats are available to players who choose them.</p>

          <p>Unique backgrounds have the following limitations:</p>

          <ol>

            <li><strong>Unique.</strong> You may only pick a particular unique background if no one else in your party has chosen it.</li>

            <li><strong>No Feature.</strong> You do not gain a background feature with a unique background.</li>

            <li><strong>Unique Flaw.</strong> In addition to the flaw you would normally choose for your character, you must choose an extra, unique flaw detailed in the description of your unique background.</li>

          </ol>

          <p>Unique backgrounds can be found in <em>Pasts: The Enchanted</em> and <em>Pasts: The Hallowed</em>.</p>

          <h3>Firearms</h3>

          <p>Renaissance firearms, explosives and firearm proficiencies - as described in chapter 9 of the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em> - are available to some characters.</p>

          <p>Fighters gain the firearms proficiency at 1st level, and they can choose to be equipped with a pistol with 20 bullets where they could choose a crossbow with 20 bolts, or longbow or shortbow with 20 arrows.</p>

          <h3>Gritty Variants</h3>

          <p>In addition to firearms and explosives, Black Griffin uses a couple of optional or variant rules to make play more gritty and realistic. In particular, DMs should use the rules for injuries and gritty realism rest from chapter 9 of the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em>.</p>

      <ink-page class="content">
          <div class="aside">
            <h4>Variant: Stealth Spellcasting</h4>

            <p>In a world where you can be burned alive for witchcraft or heresy, spellcasters have, by necessity, found ways to conceal their magic from prying eyes.</p>

            <p>When attempting to cast a spell with verbal or somatic components you can declare you are attempting to cast it stealthily. If you succeed an Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) check you manage to cast the spell without alerting anyone nearby that something blasphemous has occurred. The DC of the check depends on the casting time of the spell:</p>

            <table>
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>Casting Time</th>
                  <th>DC</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>

              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>Reaction</td>
                  <td>10</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Bonus Action</td>
                  <td>10</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>1 action or more</td>
                  <td>13</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>1 minute or longer</td>
                  <td>17</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>1 hour or longer</td>
                  <td>25</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>The DM has the final say on whether a spell can be cast stealthily. Some spells are so obvious they can't be cast stealthily, such as <em>fireball</em>.</p>

        <h2 id="black-griffin-faction">Faction: Company of the Black Griffin</h2>

        <div class="columns">

          <p>The Company of the Black Griffin (often just called &#39;Griffin Company&#39;) is a mercenary army commanded by the ageing Captain Larke. For a century now it has journeyed east, seeking fortune and glory.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Last Chances.</em></strong> There is no shadier collection of characters than the mercenaries of Griffin Company. By imperial decree, recruits may be pardoned of all previous crimes. This attracts an assortment of criminals, exiles and misfits seeking a second chance in life.</p>

          <p>But there are no third chances in Griffin Company. All infractions are dealt with harshly, and it's not uncommon to see public floggings and even executions in company camps.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Fetches.</em></strong> The most serious crime of all is desertion, which carries a penalty of death. The problem was so severe that, in years past, company commanders would form small parties of <q>fetches</q> (bounty hunters) to bring deserters to justice.</p>

          <p>Fetches were so useful they became a permanent part of the company. Now they are used for all kinds of "off the book" work, such as espionage, sabotage and even assassination.</p>

          <p><strong><em>United by a Charter.</em></strong> The Company Charter is an ancient document that outlines the bylaws and core mission of the Company, as well as including a lengthy history of its decades-long migration east. Walter the Scribe (and penny-pinching bursar) keeps the Charter updated with it&#39;s current travels. The Charter is a massive collection of notes, torn scraps, scrolls and other miscellany collected over the years, all bound in black leather into a rough tome.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Black Griffin Crest.</em></strong> Members of Griffin Company are known by the crest worn on the shoulder and shields: a rampant, black griffin on a gold background.</p>

          <h3>Beliefs and Goals</h3>

          <p><strong>Discipline.</strong> All company members must abide by the laws as written in the Charter (Lawful)</p>

          <p><strong>For the Gold.</strong> We fight for a reason and that reason is gold! (Neutral)</p>

          <h3>Missions</h3>

          <p>Typical missions involve:</p>

          <p><strong>Deserters Wanted Dead or Alive.</strong> Desertion is the worst crime a mercenary can commit. All company members have a mandate to kill or capture deserters, if they find them.</p>

          <p><strong>Finding Contracts.</strong> Contracts are the lifeblood of the company and characters that get clients to sign them are accorded immense respect.</p>

          <p><strong>Recruitment.</strong> For many, the life of a sellsword is short and brutal. All Company men are charged refill its ranks by all legal means.</p>
