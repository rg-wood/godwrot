## Style Guide

When writing for **GODWROT** there are set of standards for language and formatting that should be followed, as well as tings you need to consider. 

### Spelling and Grammar

In particular, spelling should use British English.

Grammatical standards:

- Do not use Oxford commas.
- Always capitalise moves, flaw names and attributes.

Formatting standards:

- Bold game terms when they are first introduced.

### Rules

The following guidelines should be followed when modifying or adding new rules. In particular, rules should follow the themes and aesthetics of [grubby fantasy](https://rg-wood.github.io/godwrot/#grubby).

#### Flaws

[Flaws](https://rg-wood.github.io/godwrot/#flaws) should be specific so that it should be easy to decide when or when not they apply to a move. Overly vague flaws, such as Unlucky, should be avoided.

Protagonists in **GODWROT** are not only flawed, they are not grandiose or epic. Flaws that represent such themes, such as Cursed or Doomed, should be avoided. This is not dark fantasy.
