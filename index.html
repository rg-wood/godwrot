      <h2 id="about">A low fantasy campaign of grim deeds</h2>

      <p>Whereupon our scoundrels are caught in the midsts of a secret war. They'll serve shadowy masters, often at great peril. For what? Perhaps to repay a debt. Maybe a chance at a better life. Or just to survive.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>We play <strong>7-10pm (BST) every Thursday</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Text-only</strong>. We type in Roll20 and Discord. No video or audio.</li>
        <li>We'll be play-testing my low-fantasy <strong>5E hack</strong>, <a href="https://grislyeye.github.io/three-meet">Three Meet</a>. Rules may change as they evolve.</li>
        <li><strong>Magic is rare.</strong> The gods are absent, they fey in retreat. Sorry, you probably won't be playing anything like an elf or wizard.</li>
        <li>You'll be joining an <strong>existing campaign</strong> with a rich history, and two established player characters.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Of knaves, lubberworts, and goode folk</h3>

      <p>Life is hard for folk of this age. Few are left untouched by the ravages of poverty, disease, or war. And our characters are no exception. These are not heroes. These are not saints. They are imperfect, mortal, flawed, and broken. They are grubby scoundrels, pariahs, venal sellswords, or merely folk caught up in events.</p>

      <p>Yet, hardship breeds ingenuity. Gunpowder weapons are changing the face of war. The printing press is spreading dangerous, new ideas. Yet superstition and ignorance still reign.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="page" id="dismas">
      <h3>Our adventure takes place in foul Dismas</h3>

      <p>Ancient <strong>Dismas</strong>. The City that Eats Itself. A blistering canker on the arse of the <strong>Easterly Sea</strong>. A corrupt miser gnawing at its own bones. Its streets run black with filth. A wretched beggar on every corner.</p>

      <p>Now riven by war. Two factions divide Dismas. The city north of the River Hy has been taken by the <strong>Commonwealth Army</strong> in a fiery siege. Only the south districts remain loyal to the <strong>Three Kings</strong>. An uneasy truce abides, about which spies, profiteers, and mercenaries swarm like flies.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="page" id="gods">
      <h3>The Gods, Old and New</h3>

      <p>Dismas is dominated by the worship of the New Gods: <strong>The Mother</strong> and <strong>The Father</strong>, the ancestral parents of humanity. Shrines to The Mother dot the city, and the <strong>Holy Temple of the Father</strong> rules in all but name under the leadership of the <strong>Mad Bishop of Dismas.</strong></p>

      <p>Beyond Dismas <strong>The Old Ways</strong> still linger, despite the best efforts of the <strong>Witch Finders</strong>. Folk still curse the name of <strong>The Bastard</strong>, the illegitimate son of the Father. And if the gods are absent, what of <strong>Hell</strong>?</p>
    </section>

    <section class="page" id="world">
      <h3>Beyond Dismas</h3>

      <p>Few folk travel far, and little is known of the kingdoms and lands far from Dismas. Here are some notes about what might be found or what rumours our characters might hear:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>The New Commonwealth</strong>. Little is known of what has transpired north of Dismas since the <strong>Commoner Revolution</strong> unseated the nobles of <strong>Dorshire</strong>. The fledgling Commonwealth has erased ancient borders, and reconfigured (even built) entire towns and cities so fast, the region is nearly unrecognisable.</li>

        <li><strong>North.</strong> Far north lies a wild land filled with cold climes, and hard men and women. Here warring clans constantly fight over the claim to be <strong>King O'The North</strong> and have little time to build towns or sow fields. When it isn't being razed, the town of <strong>Norton</strong> stands against the chaos as the singular bastion of order.</li>

        <li><strong>West.</strong> What lies beyond the vast woods of the <strong>Grey Woald</strong>? To some it is a meaningless question. The woods are so vast, it is easier to ask: <q>What does not?</q> Everything. Nothing.</li>

        <li><strong>South.</strong> Sunnier climes lie south but the city casts a long shadow. The kingdoms and towns here are effectively vassals to Dismas. Such places as <strong>Kastenburg</strong>, <strong>Faro</strong>, or the <strong>Duchy of Castantis</strong> are held hostage to Dismas' insatiable hunger for food, workers, and opium.</li>

        <li><strong>East.</strong> What lies beyond the cobalt waters of the <strong>Easterly Sea</strong>? Countless uncharted lands: the gold nation of <strong>Jinibia</strong>, the forlorn isles known only as <strong>The Catcalls</strong>, and the icy wastes of the <strong>Shining Lands</strong>, are to name but a few.</li>
      </ul>
