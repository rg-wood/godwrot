            <h3>The Land</h3>

            <p><em>Black Griffon</em> takes place in The Land: a vast, continental mass that is going through a renaissance-like period. The Land is still largely medieval: most of humanity</p>

            <p>Yet, in the midst of this great darkness, a few bastions of civilisation shine, beacons of hope. In the cities, abbeys and courts of men, philosophers, merchants and nobles gather together to discuss new ideas. Ideas that threaten to overturn the old orders and usher in a new age of enlightenment.</p>

            <dl>
              <dt>Age of War.</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>For many this brave, new age bears a striking resemblance to old ones. New ideas threaten old powers and embolden new ones. The inevitable result is familiar to many: war!</p>

                <p>Religious schisms, new, national borders and old, ethnic tensions divide the people anew. Brother takes arms against brother in cruel battle, made all the worse by new discoveries in explosives and firearms.</p>

                <p>In the midst of this chaos, corruption thrives. While the old authorities are distracted, thieves band together, corrupt officials take bribes and hypocrites and demagogues prosper.</p>
              </dd>

              <dt>Magic Dwindles.</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>As reason waxes, the Old Ways wane. The gods no longer intervene directly in the affairs of men. The fey, once abundant, retreat deeper into their woods. And ruthless inquisitors hunt down the last remaining practitioners and put them to the flame.</p>
              </dd>

              <dt>Intrigue and Conspiracy.</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>For most, the chaos of this age seems meaningless. Some, however, sense a deeper pattern. A hidden meaning in the disorder, a secret history of past events, circles within circles.</p>

                <p>Rumours abound of shadowy cabals that secretly control institutions, even command entire nations. Of networks of spies that criss-cross the Land, watching everyone and everything. Who really pulls the strings?</p>
              </dd>
            </dl>

            <h4>The Gods, Old and New</h4>

            <p>While the gods remain silent, their faithful are anything but. The Land is filled with acolytes, priests and zealots of <strong>The Holy Temple</strong>. They stand on city streets scolding the masses, or wander lonely roads looking for converts.</p>

            <p>The Temple is the all-powerful instrument of the New Gods, the Mother and the Father. It is a massive institution that crosses national boundaries and has its fingers in nearly every aspect of common life. No other faiths are tolerated, and even kings must bend their knee to the Hierophant.</p>

            <p>Yet the Temple is far from united, and even its inquisitors cannot stamp out all heresy. Apostates frequently find loopholes in temple law or escape the authorities.</p>

            <p>And in the shadows, dark things are still worshipped. Despite the best efforts of the witch hunters, <strong>The Old Ways</strong> still linger. Folk still curse the name of <strong>The Bastard</strong>, the illegitimate son of the Father. And if the gods are absent, what of <strong>Hell</strong>?</p>

            <h4 id="midlands">The Midlands</h4>

            <p>The events of <em>Black Griffin</em> start in the Midlands, a region of the Land notable for its grim men and women and cold and wet weather.</p>

            <p>The Midlands are divided. Revolution has struck and a new, people's republic, <strong>The Commonwealth</strong>, has arisen to the north.</p>

            <p>The remaining kings have formed an alliance, <strong>The Three Kings</strong>, and raised a grand, conscript army, <strong>The Mandatory Forces</strong> to strike down the fledgling nation. And, after months of battle, the two armies have reached an uneasy stalemate.</p>

            <aside>
              <h5>Midlands Slang</h5>

              <p>Some common slang terms in the Midlands include:</p>

              <p><strong><q>By the Father.</q></strong> Blasphemous exclamation, typically spoken in anger.</p>

              <p><strong><q>By the Mother.</q></strong> Blasphemous exclamation, typically spoken resignation.</p>

              <p><strong><q>Burn It.</q></strong> A common expletive. Sometimes <q>burn them/him/her</q> or simply <q>burn you.</q></p>
            </aside>

            <h4 id="beyond-midlands">Beyond the Midlands</h4>

            <p>Few folk travel far in the Land, and little is known of the kingdoms and lands beyond the Midlands. Here are some DM notes about what might be found or what characters might know:</p>

            <dl>
              <dt>The Commonwealth.</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>Little is known of what has transpired north of the Front since the revolution. The Commonwealth has erased ancient borders and reconfigured (and even built) entire towns and cities so fast, the region is nearly unrecognisable.</p>

                <p>It is said the fledgling nation is led from <strong>The Capital</strong>, a city under constant reconstruction. And there are many rumours of a fortress-town known only as <strong>The Bastillon</strong>, where political prisoners are kept. But little else.</p>
              </dd>

              <dt>The North.</dt>
              <dd>Far north lies a wild land filled with cold climes, and hard men and women. Here warring clans constantly fight over the claim to be <q>King O'The North</q> and have little time to build towns or sow fields. When it isn't being razed, the town of <strong>Norton</strong> stands against the chaos as the singular bastion of order.</dd>
            </dl>

            <dl>
              <dt>The West.</dt>
              <dd>What lies beyond the vast woods of the Grey Woald? To some it is a meaningless question. The woods are so vast, it is easier to ask: <q>What does not?</q> Everything. Nothing. Certainly no cities as grand as Dismas. The humble trading town of Lairn greets travellers exiting the woods via the Old Road. And beyond that is the rest of the Land.</dd>

              <dt>The Southron Kingdoms.</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>Sunnier climes lie south of Dismas but the city casts a long shadow, and the kingdoms and towns here are effectively vassals to the Midlands. For example, the once-great city of <strong>Kastenburg</strong> sits within the borders of the <strong>Duchy of Castantis</strong>. Now it is merely a gigantic slum, a city held hostage to the trade in hemp-weed poppy that keeps the opium dens of Dismas stocked.</p>

                <p>Only the burgeoning city of <strong>Faro</strong> might threaten Dismas' dominance, with its mineral rich mines. How long the Mad Bishop of Dismas tolerates this situation remains to be seen.</p>
              </dd>

              <dt>The Easterly Sea.</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>And what lies beyond the grey waters of the Easterly Sea? Countless uncharted lands: the gold nation of <strong>Jinibia</strong>, the forlorn isles known only as <strong>The Catcalls</strong> and the icy wastes of the <strong>Shining Lands</strong> are to name but a few.</p>

                <p>The closest port of call is the city of <strong>Port Redsand</strong>, pirate-haven and thorn in the side of merchants everywhere.</p>

            <h3>Black Griffin Characters</h3>

            <p>You start the campaign as mercenaries in the employ of the infamous Company of the Black Griffin. Lowly even for sellswords, you have been placed on punishment duty as <em>company fetches</em>: bounty hunters charged with capture of deserters for trial.</p>

            <p>With this in mind, when you create your characters you are:</p>

            <ol>
              <li><strong>Low-magic</strong>. You are limited to <em>low-magic</em> character options unless you pick a <em>unique background</em> (see below).</li>
              <li><strong>Mercenaries</strong>. You start with Renown 1 in the <em>Company of the Black Griffon</em> faction. Remember to note the faction perks on your character sheet.</li>
              <li><strong>Renaissance Men and Women</strong>. You live in a period analogous to the early Renaissance. Magic is waning and strange new ideas spread, causing war and upending the old orders in their wake. You may be trained in the use of <em>firearms</em> (see below).</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Low-Magic Characters</h4>

            <p>Normally, low-magic characters are limited to playing humans and choosing from the following classes:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Path of Berserker Barbarian</li>
              <li>Battle Master <em>or</em> Champion Fighter</li>
              <li>Thief <em>or</em> Assassin Rogue</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Unique Backgrounds</h5>

            <p>If you want to play a magical character you can select a unique background at the start of character creation, instead of a normal background. A unique background represents a rare or special origin that might give your character access to magical races or classes (or feats) in a way that is sympathetic to low-magic campaigns.</p>

            <p>Each unique background lists which magical races, classes and feats are available to players who choose them.</p>

            <p>Unique backgrounds have the following limitations:</p>

            <ol>

              <li><strong>Unique.</strong> You may only pick a particular unique background if no one else in your party has chosen it.</li>

              <li><strong>No Feature.</strong> You do not gain a background feature with a unique background.</li>

              <li><strong>Unique Flaw.</strong> In addition to the flaw you would normally choose for your character, you must choose an extra, unique flaw detailed in the description of your unique background.</li>

            </ol>

            <p>Unique backgrounds can be found in other <strong>Grisly Eye Games</strong> monographs, such as <em><q>The Enchanted</q></em> and <em><q>The Hallowed</q></em>.</p>

            <h4>Factions</h4>

            <p>Black Griffon is a campaign of intrigue and conspiracies. With this in mind, it makes heavy use of the rules for factions in chapter 1 of the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em>.</p>

            <h4>Firearms</h4>

            <p>Renaissance firearms, explosives and firearm proficiencies - as described in chapter 9 of the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em> - are available to some characters.</p>

            <p>Fighters gain the firearms proficiency at 1st level, and they can choose to be equipped with a pistol with 20 bullets where they could choose a crossbow with 20 bolts, or longbow or shortbow with 20 arrows.</p>

            <div class="aside">
              <h5>Languages of the Land</h5>

              <p>Common fantasy languages like Elvish do not exist in the Land. Instead, the following languages are available to characters:</p>

              <p><strong>Common.</strong> The trade tongue and international lingua franca, descended from Imperial.</p>

              <p><strong>Imperial.</strong> The dead language of the Old Empire, largely forgotten except in academic circles.</p>

              <p><strong>The Half Tongue.</strong> The Half Tongue is pidgin language, with words from Common and the forgotten language of the pagans.</p>

              <p><strong>Enochian.</strong> The esoteric language of the angels, popular in occult circles.</p>

              <p><strong>The Witch's Tongue.</strong> This blasphemous language is said to be taught by demons to their infernal followers.</p>

            <h3>Gritty Variants</h3>

            <p>It is recommended you play with the variant rules for <em>injuries</em> and <em>gritty realism rest</em> from chapter 9 of the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em>, in addition to the following.</p>

            <h4>Stealth Spellcasting</h4>

            <p>In a world where you can be burned alive for witchcraft or heresy, spellcasters have, by necessity, found ways to conceal their magic from prying eyes.</p>

            <p>When attempting to cast a spell you can declare you are attempting to cast it stealthily. To successfully conceal your spellcasting you must make a Dexterity (Stealth) check if the spell has verbal components or Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check if the spell has somatic or material components contested by the Wisdom (Perception) of any possible witnesses.</p>

            <p>If a spell has both verbal and somatic or material components the DM determines which skill should be used.</p>

            <p>While all spells can be cast stealthily, the results many spells are so blatant (such as <em>fireball</em>) that it becomes obvious after the fact that something magical occurred. At the DM's discretion, when you cast an blatant spell it is immediately obvious to any creature who can see you that you were the spellcaster.</p>

            <h4>New Equipment</h4>

            <p>Includes a backpack, a bedroll, a bag of caltrops, 5 manacles with a key, 5 candles, a signal whistle, 5 days rations, and a waterskin.</p>

            <h5>Torturer's Tools</h5>

            <p>These fiendish tools are designed to inflict maximum pain while keeping a victim alive as long as possible. Proficiency with these tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to torture or interrogate a captive.</p>

            </table>

            <h5>Healer</h5>

            <p>Healers are trained in the ways of folk healing, using herbs . They can offer a +2 to Intelligence (Medicine) checks to diagnose, heal or cure a creature. They can also be hired to help physicians and other healers to give advantage on their Intelligence (Medicine) checks.</p>

            <h5>Physician</h5>

            <p>Physicians are men and women of reason (or so they believe) who dedicate their lives to the study of medicine. They have +4 to Intelligence (Medicine) checks to diagnose, heal or cure a creature.</p>

            <p>Each time you hire a physician you have a 1 in 4 chance (1 on a 1d4) of hiring a quack instead, who has a -2  to Intelligence (Medicine) checks instead. The DM rolls secretly to determine this.</p>

            <h5>Master Physician</h5>

            <p>Master physicians are the most gifted masters of the science of medicine, and are equally rare. They have +6 to Intelligence (Medicine) checks to diagnose, heal or cure a creature. Extremely rare and in demand, they can only be found around royal courts, universities or in large cities.</p>

            <p>The layout and style of this monograph was based on the <span class="title">Dungeon Masters Guild</span> <span class="product">Adventure Template</span>. The main font is <em>Alegreya</em> by Juan Pablo del Peral which is more elegant and legible than the template default. It is also hosted on Google Webfonts and supports "true" italics and bold. The title font was <em>Andada SC</em>.</p>

            <p>This document was published using HTML, JavaScript and CSS, and composed using open-source technologies including Node.js, Grunt, NPM, SASS, Polymer and Lit. The PDF was published using the <a href="https://github.com/ink-elements">Ink Framework</a>. The monster stat blocks were generated using <a href="https://github.com/grislyeye/vellum-monster"><code>&lt;vellum-monster&gt;</code></a> based on Val Markovic's open source <em>Statblock5e</em>.</p>

            <p>I would especially like to thank my playtesters and reviewers. The roll call includes:</p>
