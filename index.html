          <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

          <p><strong>Black Griffin</strong> is a gritty campaign where the characters are members of a shady mercenary company on the wrong side of a war. Characters will be sent on missions to chip away at enemy factions as part of a new style of play called the "faction sandbox".</p>

          <p>This book should be accompanied by a copy of the <em>Black Griffon Player's Guide</em> (available for free from <em>Grisly Eye Games</em>) which you can give to your players. It includes the rules for making characters for this campaign, as well as pre-generated characters for fast play.</p>

          <h4 id="faction-sandbox">The Faction Sandbox</h4>

          <p>After the first adventure ('The Nightmare Under Dismas') has established the setting and characters, the game turns into a faction sandbox:</p>

          <p>In a faction sandbox, at the end of each session the DM generates three new missions. The players decide amongst themselves which mission to run for the next session. The DM then turns this mission into a mini-adventure as part of his session preparation. The process is repeated for the next session after that and so on.</p>

          <p>In addition to the normal rewards and risks of adventures, missions have impacts on the wider world of factions. New factions can appear on the scene, and old factions maybe weakened or empowered by the party's actions.</p>

          <h4 id="factions">Factions</h4>

          <p>The factions sandbox builds on the rules for factions and organisations from chapter 1 of the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em>. Factions in the sandbox are described with the following additional details:</p>

          <p><em><strong>Level and Difficulty.</strong></em> A faction’s level is expressed as a range of levels to give you an idea of its relative strength (levels 1–4, 5–10, 11–16, and 17– 20).  It is then labeled as an easy, medium, or hard. The faction’s level tells you how powerful it is compared to others of its level range.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Missions.</strong></em> A random table of typical missions this faction carries out when not in direct conflict with another.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Leaders.</strong></em> A random table of the most powerful and notable members of this faction, accompanied by stat blocks for these NPCs.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Strongholds.</strong></em> A random table of locations important to this faction. These locations will be accompanied by detailed maps and notes elsewhere in the faction description.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Followers.</strong></em> A random encounter table for common members of this faction. This maybe accompanied by stat blocks for these NPCs.</p>

          <h4 id="faction-deck">The Faction Deck</h4>

          <p>The faction deck represents the balance of power between the factions in your world. The more cards a faction has, the more powerful it is. As factions expend their resources or face defeat, they lose cards. Similarly, victorious factions gain cards.</p>

          <p>The number of cards a faction has initially depends on their difficulty. When adding factions to a faction deck, refer to the Initial Faction Deck table below:</p>

          <table id="initial-faction-deck-table">
            <caption>Initial Faction Deck</caption>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Faction Difficulty</th>
                <th class="number">Initial Cards</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>

            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>Easy</td>
                <td class="number">5</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Medium</td>
                <td class="number">10</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Hard</td>
                <td class="number">15</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

          <p>You can just use index cards and write the name of the faction on each one.</p>

          <h4 id="creating-missions">Creating Missions</h4>

          <p>To create a new mission, randomly draw a or choose a faction card from the faction deck. If you are a member of this faction, roll for a random mission from the table in its description.</p>

          <p>Otherwise, this is the enemy faction involved in this mission. Roll on the Mission Types table below.</p>

          </table>

          <p>Missions can be of three different types, which determine how they affect the faction deck:</p>

          <p><em><strong>Offensive.</strong></em> A direct attack on an enemy faction.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Defensive.</strong></em> Defending against an enemy faction attack.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Support.</strong></em> Non-conflict missions that support or maintain the faction.</p>

          <div class="aside" id="mission-timers">
            <h5>Variant Rule: Mission Timers</h5>

            <p>Faction sandbox worlds can still seem passive, only changing in reaction to the player characters. If you want to make your worlds more dynamic you can use these variant rules for mission timers:</p>

            <p>Rather than generate a complete set of new missions after each session, missions persist for longer. Each mission has a number of timer checkboxes. Each session a mission is not taken by the party, a mission checkbox is marked off. Once all the checkboxes are marked off the mission defaults as though it failed, and the mission penalties come into effect.</p>
          </div>

          <h4 id="turning-missions-into-adventures">Turning Missions into Adventures</h4>

          <p>Once the players have chosen the mission for next weeks session, the DM needs to turn it into an adventure. The adventure, encounter, nonplayer character and environment creation guidelines and tables from chapters 3, 4 and 5 of the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em> are invaluable for this.</p>

          <p>You can use the strongholds and followers from the faction description in your adventure locations and encounters. You are, of course, also allowed to include whatever monsters, NPCs and locations you like.</p>

          <p>Missions should be shorter than normal adventures, typically taking about a day of game time (not including travel) and concluding in one or two sessions. You should plan the encounters accordingly.</p>

          <p>Most missions should also include one or two complications, possibly involving new factions where the player character's actions may decide whether they become friend or foe. You can choose or roll for a random faction using the Factions table in chapter 3.</p>

          <h4 id="between-missions">Between Missions</h4>

          <p>In addition to the normal downtime activities between adventures you should adjust the faction deck according to the outcome of the last mission. This reflects the change in the balance of power resulting from the character's actions. Factions lose or gain cards from the faction deck according to the type of mission and whether it was successful or not:</p>

        <h2>The Nightmare Under Dismas</h2>

      </ink-page>

      <ink-page class="content">
        <div class="columns">

          <p>This introductory mini-adventure introduces the setting and allows the characters to get to know each other. Read the following to the party:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>The Black Griffin Company limps towards it's newest commission: reinforcing the royalist frontline against the Commonwealth Forces.</p>

            <p>In the wake of its last defeat, dessertion is rife. You've been sent ahead to the ancient city of Dismas to capture and return your erstwhile colleague, Crawface. For this you will receive a bounty of 140 gold pieces. You only get half if he's dead.</p>

            <p>You believe you've tracked him to a seedy poorhouse in the slum, Cemetery Hill. You watch the derelict building from the shadows of a nearby alley, under cover of night. Tramps and beggars come and go, or linger outside warming themselves by street fires.</p>

            <p>What will you do?</p>
          </blockquote>

          <!-- Lead into the action faster: confusing beginning with no obvious things to do. -->

          <p>The party should find the poorhouse with little trouble.</p>

          <h4 id="the-poorhouse">1. The Poorhouse</h4>

          <p>If the players approach the poorhouse read the following:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>You can smell the rickety, poorhouse before you approach it. The thick stench of sweat, rotten food and despair is overwhelming. All but a handful of the wretches lingering scatter as you approach. The remaining members glare balefully at you.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>The poorhouse is actually a front for a smuggling operation in-and-out of the city. However, the beggars won't just tell strangers about it.</p>

          <p><em><strong>"King" Sam (Choleric, Venal).</strong></em> Sam is the self-styled beggar "king". If the players start asking questions he will be pointed out to them. If they make any fuss he comes out to investigate. He will help the players in exchange for money. He has a heavy cough caused by the black mold in his "throne room". Passive Perception check vs DC 15 to notice the mold, Intelligence (Medicine) check vs DC 15 to diagnose the cough. If they players can convince him he will reveal the hidden shaft (see below).</p>

          <p><em><strong>Secret: Miraculous Cure.</strong></em> Characters who spend any time watching the beggars coming and going notice on a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check vs DC 13 notice a hunchback beggar entering the poorhouse and, then leaving moments later cured of his deformity!</p>

          <p><em><strong>Secret: The List.</strong></em>Characters making passive Wisdom (Perception) check vs DC 15 notice the building listing a little towards the rear of the house. </p>

          <p><em><strong>Secret: The Hidden Shaft.</strong></em> In King Sam's "throne room" there is an innocuous looking fireplace. On closer inspection the chimney stack has fallen through leaving a shaft leading to a hidden basement which is being used by smugglers. Anyone searching the room to will find it on a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check vs DC 15.</p>

          <h4 id="smugglers-hideout">2. The Smuggler's Hideout</h4>

          <p>If the players climb down the chimney stack they arrive at the smuggler's hideout. Its pitch black but if the characters have a light source read the following:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>This small, damp room is stacked with boxes. Some of the crates are smashed, and bottles of spirits and other contraband spill out. A man lies dead in a pool of blood in the middle of the room</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p><em><strong>The Corpse</strong></em> The man is not Crawface, but a smuggler killed by a series of knife wounds to the stomach. Searching his body uncovers a folded piece of paper wrapping 9 gp. The piece of paper is a map of the smuggling route through the sewers and offers advantage on sewer crawl checks to escape the sewers.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Box of Rats.</strong></em> A passive Wisdom (Perception) check vs DC 10 indicates scratching noises from one box. If the characters open it two rats spill out and attempt to run to the hidden tunnel behind the boxes.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Secret: Hidden Booty.</strong></em> A successful Intelligence (Investigation) check vs DC 20 uncovers a hidden of 9 bottles of fine brandy worth 10 gp each, hidden in a crate.</p>

        </div>
      </ink-page>

      <ink-page class="content">
        <div class="columns">

          <p><em><strong>Secret: Hidden Tunnel.</strong></em> Intelligence (Investigation) vs DC 15 to spot a trail of blood leading here:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>A rough tunnel is hidden behind a stack of crates, formed by pulling down the ancient bricks of the basement wall. The trail of blood leads into its shadowy recesses. The sound of trickling water comes from beyond.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <h4 id="dismas-sewers">2. Dismas' Sewers</h4>

          <p>The party find themselves in the city <strong>sewers</strong> and can attmept to follow the trail of blood. Use the ryles for city crawling (se page XX).</p>

          <h4 id="old-spits-nest">4. Old Spit's Nest</h4>

          <p>Old Spit's nest is the domain of the vermus. Random encounters here are always 1d4 vermus.</p>

              <h5>Hidden Fall</h5>
              <p>Medium Mechanical Trap (200 XP)</p>
            </header>

            <p>This section of the sewers is covered in refuse, concealing an open hole covered by weakened boards and a sackcloth blanket. The boards will give way if players step on them.</p>

            <p>A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns the shape of the blanket where it has been disturbed by vermus coming and going from the nest. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of the floor is actually the cover of a hole.</p>

            <p>When a creature steps on the boards, they break, causing the the intruder to spill into the 20 foot pit below, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage and landing in area 4B.</p>

          </div>

          <h5 id="bottom-of-pit">4B. Bottom of the Pit</h5>

          <p>Climbing back up their sheer surface of the hole back to the sewers requires a DC 20 Strength (Athletics). A failed check means the character gets halfway up the wall before losing their grip and falling 10 feet (1d6 bludgeoning damage). Climbing down is easier, only required a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.</p>

          <p>At the bottom of the pit is pool about 1 foot deep filled with brackish, stagnant water, Various tunnels line the bottom of the pit. From within can be heard the distant sounds of scratches and rat-like chittering.</p>

          <h5 id="warrens">4C. Warrens</h5>

          <p>If the party enters warrens via the tunnels in area 4A they start the Warren Crawling challenge.</p>

          <div class="aside" id="warren-crawling">
            <header>

            <p>The party attempt to sneak through the narrow vermus warrens without attracting attention.</p>

            <p><strong>Success (3): </strong> The party manages to reach their desired destination, or a random one if they're exploring (see table below). Each time they attempt to explore the warren they gain a +1 on the random nest destination roll.</p>

            <p><strong>Failure: </strong> The party end attract the attention of the vermus, are swarmed and dragged to area 4F to be interrogated by Old Spit.</p>

            <p><strong><em>Dexterity (Sneak) DC 15.</em></strong> The party attempt to sneak through the warrens without attracting the attention of the vermus. Creatures wearing heavy armour roll with disadvantage. On a failure the party are attacked by 1d4 <strong>vermus</strong>. Players must declare single-file marching order, and the DM chooses whether characters at the rear of front of the line are attacked.</p>

            <p><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> Casting <em>sleep</em> or <em>charm person</em> grants an automatic success as you enchant your way past vermus sentries.</p>

          <h5 id="temple-spring">4D. Temple Spring</h5>

          <p>The ancient spring was once a Lythic temple. Water trickles down the walls and collect in a ceremonial pool. It is refreshing and drinkable.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>This is a small 20 foot by 30 foot room. It appears to be some kind of small shrine, and at one end it what appears to be a small statue of some forgotten god. Water trickles down the walls and collect in a ceremonial pool. Before the shrine is an alter covered in what appears to be rubbish.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p><em><strong>The Choir of Men.</strong></em> A shrine has been built here where the crazed vermus wrack, Scratch, and his fanatical followers have hidden away to worship the civilisation of men. At first, they prostrate themselves in front of the players. Scratch will make a big fuss of showing characters his collection of "relics" (human rubbish, including an old boot, a rusty bucket and a filthy child's doll). They will not betray the nest but they may help the party in other ways.</p>

          <p>The party can take a short rest here without triggering a random encounter. If the party attempt to leave, Scratch becomes rabid and they vermus attack. Scratch will attempt to escape when the other members of the choir are killed.</p>

          <h5 id="bathhouse">4F. The Bathhouse</h5>

          <p>This is the lair of Old Spit, the rat king. Read the following to the players:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>The weak light pours out beyond the doorway, revealing a shadowy bathhouse of Old Imperial design. From the shadows many pairs bright eyes glint, regarding you with inhuman malevolence.</p>

            <p>A shaft of light comes from above. Dangling in the light, wrapped in chains, in the body of your erstwhile companion, Clawface. Blood drips from his body into the fetid bath below. </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Old Spit will not attack at first, instead demanding to know why the party have entered his kingdom. The party can attempt to parlay with Old Spit, who may let them leave with Crawfaces body. If they do leave with him alive, he warns them not to reveal the presence of the vermus.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Crawface.</strong></em> Crawface body hangs from a chain, which is in turn attached to a grate. The grate leads out of the sewers to the surface. Crawface is, unfortunately, dead, killed by the vermus because he trespassed on Old Spit's kingdom (the sewers). His body carries a <em>bag of holding</em> <!-- too magical? --> containing 5 rubies worth 50 gp each.</p>

          <p>If the players enter the bathhouse read the following:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Your light passes over ancient mosaic frescoes, depicting old Imperial men and women cavorting with rat like beings.</p>

          <h4 id="agata">Sergeant Agata</h4>

          <p>Sergeant Agata and her mute bodyguard, Corporal Loth, are pariahs. Nominally in charge of the fetches, Agata is obsessed with conspiracies within the Griffin Company. Her brusque manner doesn't win her any friends either.</p>

          <h4 id="hyde">Corporal Hyde</h4>

          <p>Despite his lazy attitude, Hyde remains favoured of the fetches. Somehow he, and his team of spies, cutthroats  and knaves, always seems to come through with the goods. To look at the man you would not understand why: short, fat, balding. Hyde is obviously past his prime, seemingly always out of breath and covered in a sheen of sweat. Yet, as soon as he flashes his winning smile, all that is forgotten, his silver tongue getting out of all kinds of mischief.</p>

          <p>The reasons for Hyde's success is simple: he's completely corrupt. His many successes are the result of playing both sides off against each other. The only reasons he gets away with it is because he's Lieutenant Vins' brother!</p>

          <p>Hyde uses the stats for <strong>grizzled mercenary</strong> (see below) in combat.</p>

          <h4 id="larke">Captain Larke</h4>

          <p>Captain Larke commands the Griffin Company. However, his once iron grip has loosened with age and, if the rumours are to be believed, drink. His lieutenants keep a close eye on his health, and each other, waiting for the day they can step into his boots.</p>

          <p>Larke uses the stats for <strong>veterans</strong> in combat.</p>

          <h4 id="walter">Walter the Scribe</h4>

          <p>Despite being a non-combatant, Walter is probably the second most important person in the Company next to Larke. Although, to his chagrin, rarely gets credit. Walter maintains the Charter (as one of the few people who can read and write) as well as handling the Company coffers as bursar. This means he knows all the company's dirty secrets.</p>

          <p>Walter uses the stats for <strong>commoners</strong> in combat.</p>

          <p><em><strong>New Model Army.</strong></em> The Commonwealth Army is unlike any army to come before. Its ranksvare made up of common-folk who took up arms to protect the Commonwealth against its Royalist enemies. Farmhands rub shoulders with seamstresses, burghers with mothers, some still suckling their babes.</p>

          <h4>The Communes</h4>

          <p>The poor of Dismas are getting organised, forming into communes inspired by the Peasant Revolution. These communes protect the poorest against the predations of corrupt nobles and organised crime. The communes are thought to be riddled with Commonwealth spies.</p>

          <p>Most often, protection comes in the form of violence. The true heroes of the communes are the blocs: gangs of street fighters who don their signature face scarves so they can anonymously protect the most vulnerable citizens of Dismas.</p>

          <h4>Father John</h4>

          <p>The rebellion would be nothing without the support of vocal clergymen, lead by the fanatic, John(?). Rumours abound of the miracles John performs, such is his fanatical devotion to the father. There is an uneasy alliance between the increasing fanaticism of the rebel priests and the peasant factions.</p>

          <h4>Mina</h4>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Before you stands a figure wrapped in a thick coat, their face covered by scarves and a low hat.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Mina is a Commonwealth spy operating out of Dismas and worshipper of the New Faith. She suffers terrible skin burns all over her body, so she keeps completely covered. Mina has a secret past as an ex-Royalist soldier. She put down many peasant revolutions for the nobility, so makes amends now by serving the Commonwealth, distributing political propaganda and spying.</p>

            <p><em>Faction (level 1-4, hard)</em></p>
          </header>

          <!-- Fantasy mafia -->

          <!-- emphasise mock culture. "guild" is a term of mockey -->

          <!-- a collection of smaller guilds banding together, the Night Court -->

          <p><q>Thieves Guild</q> is a name you only hear in whispers, if at all. This ancient alliance of blackguards, scoundrels and rogues has disbanded and reformed many times and is currently.</p>

          <p>No one claims membership, the city watch pretends it doesn&#39;t exist and the thief kings take great pains to make sure the name never reaches the ears of king or queen. Indeed, The Guild (as it is sometimes called) is known mostly to the common folk, and then only by reputation. </p>

          <p>And a fearsome reputation it has. The Thief Kings and Queens are known for their violence and rule their night empires through intimidation and fear. Those who cross them are often the victims of threats and vicious beatings.</p>

          <p>However, despite their bluster, the thief kings could not rule through intimidation alone.</p>

          <p>The worst offenders simply disappear. Forever.</p>

          <p><strong><em>The Thieves Code.</em></strong> While it might seem absurd for criminals to abide by a set of laws, the <q>Thieves Code</q> plays an important role. The code keeps the peace (somewhat) between thieves and prevents crime from getting out of hand and attracting the attention of the authorities and irate mobs.</p>

          <p>The code also ensures the victims of the guild are treated with a (relatively) fair hand. For example, enthusiastic thieves who regularly kill their victims can be <q>disappeared</q>. What is more, guild members are often expected to give back to their communities. RESPECT</p>

          <p><strong><em>The Fourth Estate.</em></strong> The thief kings often fancy themselves as the <q>fourth estate</q> of society, after the nobles, peasants and clergy. Indeed, their titles and ranks are meant as a sort of mockery of lawful society.</p>

          <p>The guild prides itself on its ability to act when the other estates fail. When the stifling rules of lawful society block or impede, the guild can step in to smooth the way. Merchants turn to the guild when they need to move certain goods across borders. The common folk often turn to the Guild for justice when common law fails them.</p>

          <p>And the Guild usually obliges... for a price.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Law of Tithe.</em></strong> The Thieves Guild always gets its cut. All members must tithe one tenth (10%) of any ill-gotten gains to guild coffers. Failure to do so (and getting caught) often results in a severe beating. No one hears from those who get caught a second time.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Uneasy Alliance.</em></strong> The guild is divided into several jurisdictions, usually centred around a particular city. Each territory is ruled by a thief king or queen. Rumours hint that they gather each year to negotiate agreements and iron out differences, so as to keep the peace between cities. If true, such a meeting would be a true nexus of misrule and evil and striking here could do a serious blow to the guild.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Thief Sign and Mark.</em></strong> Guild members can make themselves known to each other by a discreet Thieves Cant hand sign. Guild safe houses and hangouts are also marked with the Thieves Mark.</p>

          </header>

          <p>Ancient Dismas huddles against the cold shores of the Western Sea. In it's warren of streets, knaves rub shoulders with carousing nobles. Slums squat in the shadows of it's looming cathedral. And merchants from across the world hawk their dubious wares.</p>

          <p><em><strong>The City of Thieves.</strong></em> Despite being one of the poorest cities in all the Land, Dismas attracts a constant stream of migrants. Many are ex-farmers from even poorer, rural areas who come to the city looking for work. And like like flies around shit, so too come the thieves. The city fathers try to keep the poorest citizens within the outer city.</p>

          <p>Yet, despite the best attempts by the Watch, the poor folk seems to seep through the Inner Wall. Slums grow like weeds everywhere. Beggars cry for alms in the shadows of the Great Cathedral. And pickpockets are a constant problem.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Ancient Metropolis.</strong></em> Dismas has existed for as long as there have been men (and perhaps before even then). It's decrepit, rotten tenements pile on top of foundations and ruins of older buildings. If you dig deep enough, crumbling bricks of the modern era give way to the stone of the city's ancient Imperial past.</p>

          <p><em><strong>The Powder Keg.</strong></em> While the advance of the Commonwealth Army has been halted, word of the peasant rebellion has not. The swelling ranks of the poor and destitute whisper of dissent. Such talk is brutally suppressed and anyone found spreading sedition are hung as traitors, burned as heretics, or simply disappeared.</p>

          <p>Yet even these draconian measures cannot fully suppress the flourishing communal spirits of the city's poorest. Each day revolt seems to draw ever closer, striking fear and fury into the hearts of the city fathers.</p>

          <p>In years gone, the dead passed through Barrowgate to be interred in Cemetery Hill. Now Barrowgate provides a more important function: keeping vagabonds, thieves and and other shady elements from entering the inner city. It does so with limited success.</p>

          <p>Everyday thousands pass through the gate here, under the watchful eyes of the skeletal frescoes that adorn the walls. The Watch try to keep out the worst, yet thieves easily hide in the throng, pass over the crumbling walls, or sneak underneath, through the Catacombs.</p>

          <p>This sprawling warren of slums sits outside the inner city, north of Barrowgate. In centuries past, this was the name of literal hill where the city's dead were interred. Being the least desirable area, yet nearest the city, it attracted the poorest of the city folk.</p>

          <p>Now, the actual cemetery is tiny part of the district. Cemetery Hill itself is a massive sprawl of shanties, hovels, and work houses that makes up the greater part of the city. Poverty is rife, beggars are everywhere. The only industries that thrive are the foulest, smelliest ones that would not be tolerated behind the city walls.</p>

          <h5 id="annie-house">1. The Annie House</h5>

          <p>On first appearances, The Annie House appears to be a workhouse for young girls and women that launders clothing. In reality, it's a front for a Commonwealth Army spy ring (see page <ink-page-ref ref="commonwealth-army"></ink-page-ref>).</p>

          <h6 id="annie-house-main-entrance">1.1. Main Entrance</h6>

          <p>Read the following:</p>

          <blockquote><p>The grand, double-gated entrance to the Annie House stands at the end of a long alleyway. Tenements stand either side, so tall and decrepit they seem to about to fall on you.</p></blockquote>

          <p>The main entrance gate is normally kept unlocked. 4 <strong>bloc toughs</strong> (see page <ink-page-ref ref="bloc-tough"></ink-page-ref>) hide in watch from the rooftops of the surrounding tenements.</p>

          <p>If fighting starts they are joined in two rounds by 4 more <strong>bloc toughs</strong> from area 1.9.</p>

          <h6 id="annie-house-rear-yard">1.2. Rear Yard</h6>

          <p>Read the following:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>You make your way from the cobbled streets, down some slippery stairs to a large yard. The rears of several houses tower around, creating a secluded area.</p>

            <p>Before you is the rear of the Annie House, stairs leading up to a small door. </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p><em><strong>Stray dogs.</strong></em> 4 <strong>mastiffs</strong> fight over an dead rat here. They attack if disturbed, otherwise they ignore the party.</p>

          <h6 id="annie-house-rear-entrance">1.3. Rear Entrance</h6>

          <p>Read the following:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>You find yourself in front of a sturdy looking door. There is a small grate at eye height. </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p><em><strong>Old Maid.</strong></em> A forgetful old woman guards the doorway. She must be convinced to allow anyone to enter the premises (DC 15, with disadvantage for men).</p>

          <p>Normally "annies" - washerwomen - can be found here busily washing and drying large, white sheets.</p>

          <p>This dingy store cupboard is piled high with cleaning tools. An old rug in a corner is actually a badly disguised trap door leading to area 1.6. It requires a Wisdom (Investigation) check vs DC 12 to find. A passive Wisdom (Perception) check of 12 will reveal that a corner of the rug is folded up.</p>

          <h6 id="annie-house-basement">1.6. Basement</h6>

          <p>This area is the secret basement of the Annie House. The area is dark and dusty, with thin walls made of crumbling bricks.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Bricked Up Door.</strong></em> A passive Wisdom (Perception) check vs DC 12 (with disadvantage with low light) is required to spot that bricks in one part of the wall seem newer. Pulling down the bricks reveals an entrance to room 1.10.</p>

            <li><strong>The Labours of Women.</strong> A list of the many uncompensated jobs of women.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>All are beautifully illustrated by Mina.</p>

          <h6 id="annie-house-secret-exit">1.9. Bloc Forum</h6>

          <p>This room is centered around a large table. If the party aren't expected, a lively debate is ensuing here. Mina and 4 <strong>bloc toughs</strong> can be found here.</p>

          <p>The Chalk Quarter is the mercantile heart of Dismas, home to guilds, merchant houses and associated. Named after the chalk used by the various clearing houses.</p>

          <p>Salt Gate is an internal city wall that divides the Docks from the Chalk Quarter, allowing the city to collect taxes on imported goods and the wealthy merchants to separate themselves from the squalor of the Docks. Over centuries the various gate houses, clerks quarters and watch houses have become a district all to themselves.</p>

          <p>The Tarry is a small out-town that sits outside the outer wall. Here you'll find a mix of travellers, merchants and soldiers waiting to get into the city, or getting ready to leave, and various misfits too undesirable even for the outer city. Taverns, inns and hovels to accommodate these hunker against the outer walls. Long queues past the corrupt watchmen guarding the gates are common.</p>

            <h4>Interrogation</h4>
            <p><em>Skill Challenge (level 1-4, difficulty varies)</em></p>
          </header>

          <p>The Land is at war, but it is like no war before it. Where once battles were won by the sharpest blade or most courageous will, secrets and lies are now deciding factors. So the ability to extract information from unwilling prisoners is vital. In addition to arsenals or pistols, infantry and armour, moden armies also have spies and interrogators skilled in the arts of torture.</p>

          <p><strong>Success (3):</strong> You gain the information you desire. If you allow the target to rest before you gain all successes they lose all exhaustion levels but you lose all successes (but not failures!).</p>

          <p><strong>Failure:</strong> You gain incorrect or misleading information. If this information is vital to the success of the mission, you fail that mission.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Charisma (Deception, Intimidation or Persuasion) vs target's Wisdom:</em></strong> By keeping the target awake and asking hard questions, or attempting to deceive them you can find out additional information. You must make this check with disadvantage. Each time a character uses this check the target looses a level of exhaustion.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Strength (Intimidation) or Charisma (Persuasion) vs target's Wisdom:</em></strong> By torturing the victim you can more easily acquire information. You may make this check with advantage. However, each time a character uses this check the target looses <em>two</em> levels of exhaustion and takes 1d8 damage.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Torturer's Tools vs target's Wisdom:</em></strong> With judicious use of torturer's tools, you can cause maximum pain with minimal actual physical damage. Unlike manual torture, each time a character uses this check the target looses a level of exhaustion.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Spells</em></strong> Casting <em>charm person</em> grants an automatic success.</p>

        <h3>Coming Soon</h3>

          <h4>Thanks</h4>

          <p>The layout and style of this monograph was based on the <strong>Dungeon Masters Guild</strong> <em>Adventure Template</em>. The main font is <em>Alegreya</em> by Juan Pablo del Peral which is more elegant and legible than the template default. It is also hosted on Google Webfonts and supports "true" italics and bold. The title font was <em>Andada SC</em>.</p>

          <p>This document was published using HTML, JavaScript and CSS, and composed using open source, web technologies including Node.js, Grunt, NPM, Bower, SASS, Polymer and Yarn. The PDF was generated using Chrome's PDF print preview feature. The monster stat blocks were generated using a web component of my own creation, based on Val Markovic's open source <em>Statblock5e</em>.</p>

          <p>I'd also like to thank our playtesters, including:</p>
