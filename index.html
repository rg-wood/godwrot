          <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

          <p><strong>Black Griffin</strong> is a gritty campaign where the characters are members of a shady mercenary company on the wrong side of a war. Characters will be sent on missions to chip away at enemy factions as part of a new style of play called the "faction sandbox".</p>

          <p>This book should be accompanied by a copy of the <em>Black Griffon Player's Guide</em> (available for free from <em>Grisly Eye Games</em>) which you can give to your players. It includes the rules for making characters for this campaign, as well as pre-generated characters for fast play.</p>

          <h4 id="what-you-need-to-play">What You'll Need to Play</h4>

          <p>In addition to the normal items you need to play, you'll need a set of index cards for <strong>Black Griffin</strong>. This campaign is heavily war based so you should also have a copy of the mass combat rules in <em>The Many</em>, also by <strong>Grisly Eye Games</strong>.</p>
          <!-- TODO remove this requirement by having an appendix with sample stats from The Many -->

          <h4 id="faction-sandbox">The Faction Sandbox</h4>

          <p>After the first adventure ('The Nightmare Under Dismas') has established the setting and characters, the game turns into a faction sandbox:</p>

          <p>In a faction sandbox, at the end of each session the DM generates three new missions. The players decide amongst themselves which mission to run for the next session. The DM then turns this mission into a mini-adventure as part of his session preparation. The process is repeated for the next session after that and so on.</p>

          <p>In addition to the normal rewards and risks of adventures, missions have impacts on the wider world of factions. New factions can appear on the scene, and old factions maybe weakened or empowered by the party's actions.</p>

          <h4 id="factions">Factions</h4>

          <p>The factions sandbox builds on the rules for factions and organisations from chapter 1 of the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em>. Factions in the sandbox are described with the following additional details:</p>

          <p><em><strong>Level and Difficulty.</strong></em> A faction’s level is expressed as a range of levels to give you an idea of its relative strength (levels 1–4, 5–10, 11–16, and 17– 20).  It is then labeled as an easy, medium, or hard. The faction’s level tells you how powerful it is compared to others of its level range.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Missions.</strong></em> A random table of typical missions this faction carries out when not in direct conflict with another.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Leaders.</strong></em> A random table of the most powerful and notable members of this faction, accompanied by stat blocks for these NPCs.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Strongholds.</strong></em> A random table of locations important to this faction. These locations will be accompanied by detailed maps and notes elsewhere in the faction description.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Followers.</strong></em> A random encounter table for common members of this faction. This maybe accompanied by stat blocks for these NPCs.</p>

          <h4 id="faction-deck">The Faction Deck</h4>

          <p>The faction deck represents the balance of power between the factions in your world. The more cards a faction has, the more powerful it is. As factions expend their resources or face defeat, they lose cards. Similarly, victorious factions gain cards.</p>

          <p>The number of cards a faction has initially depends on their difficulty. When adding factions to a faction deck, refer to the Initial Faction Deck table below:</p>

          <table id="initial-faction-deck-table">
            <caption>Initial Faction Deck</caption>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Faction Difficulty</th>
                <th class="number">Initial Cards</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>

            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>Easy</td>
                <td class="number">5</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Medium</td>
                <td class="number">10</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Hard</td>
                <td class="number">15</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

          <p>You can just use index cards and write the name of the faction on each one.</p>

          <h4 id="creating-missions">Creating Missions</h4>

          <p>To create a new mission, randomly draw a or choose a faction card from the faction deck. If you are a member of this faction, roll for a random mission from the table in its description.</p>

          <p>Otherwise, this is the enemy faction involved in this mission. Roll on the Mission Types table below.</p>

          </table>

          <p>Missions can be of three different types, which determine how they affect the faction deck:</p>

          <p><em><strong>Offensive.</strong></em> A direct attack on an enemy faction.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Defensive.</strong></em> Defending against an enemy faction attack.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Support.</strong></em> Non-conflict missions that support or maintain the faction.</p>

          <div class="aside" id="mission-timers">
            <h5>Variant Rule: Mission Timers</h5>

            <p>Faction sandbox worlds can still seem passive, only changing in reaction to the player characters. If you want to make your worlds more dynamic you can use these variant rules for mission timers:</p>

            <p>Rather than generate a complete set of new missions after each session, missions persist for longer. Each mission has a number of timer checkboxes. Each session a mission is not taken by the party, a mission checkbox is marked off. Once all the checkboxes are marked off the mission defaults as though it failed, and the mission penalties come into effect.</p>
          </div>

          <h4 id="turning-missions-into-adventures">Turning Missions into Adventures</h4>

          <p>Once the players have chosen the mission for next weeks session, the DM needs to turn it into an adventure. The adventure, encounter, nonplayer character and environment creation guidelines and tables from chapters 3, 4 and 5 of the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em> are invaluable for this.</p>

          <p>You can use the strongholds and followers from the faction description in your adventure locations and encounters. You are, of course, also allowed to include whatever monsters, NPCs and locations you like.</p>

          <p>Missions should be shorter than normal adventures, typically taking about a day of game time (not including travel) and concluding in one or two sessions. You should plan the encounters accordingly.</p>

          <p>Most missions should also include one or two complications, possibly involving new factions where the player character's actions may decide whether they become friend or foe. You can choose or roll for a random faction using the Factions table in chapter 3.</p>

          <h4 id="between-missions">Between Missions</h4>

          <p>In addition to the normal downtime activities between adventures you should adjust the faction deck according to the outcome of the last mission. This reflects the change in the balance of power resulting from the character's actions. Factions lose or gain cards from the faction deck according to the type of mission and whether it was successful or not:</p>

        <h2>The Nightmare Under Dismas</h2>

      </ink-page>

      <ink-page class="content">
        <div class="columns">

          <p>This introductory mini-adventure introduces the setting and allows the characters to get to know each other. Read the following to the party:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>The Black Griffin Company limps towards it's newest commission: reinforcing the royalist frontline against the Commonwealth Forces.</p>

            <p>In the wake of its last defeat, dessertion is rife. You've been sent ahead to the ancient city of Dismas to capture and return your erstwhile colleague, Crawface. For this you will receive a bounty of 140 gold pieces. You only get half if he's dead.</p>

            <p>You believe you've tracked him to a seedy poorhouse in the slum, Cemetery Hill. You watch the derelict building from the shadows of a nearby alley, under cover of night. Tramps and beggars come and go, or linger outside warming themselves by street fires.</p>

            <p>What will you do?</p>
          </blockquote>

          <!-- Lead into the action faster: confusing beginning with no obvious things to do. -->

          <p>The party should find the poorhouse with little trouble.</p>

          <h4 id="the-poorhouse">1. The Poorhouse</h4>

          <p>If the players approach the poorhouse read the following:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>You can smell the rickety, poorhouse before you approach it. The thick stench of sweat, rotten food and despair is overwhelming. All but a handful of the wretches lingering scatter as you approach. The remaining members glare balefully at you.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>The poorhouse is actually a front for a smuggling operation in-and-out of the city. However, the beggars won't just tell strangers about it.</p>

          <p><em><strong>"King" Sam (Choleric, Venal).</strong></em> Sam is the self-styled beggar "king". If the players start asking questions he will be pointed out to them. If they make any fuss he comes out to investigate. If they players can convince him he will reveal the hidden shaft (see below). See page <ink-page-ref ref="king-sam"></ink-page-ref> for more details.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Secret: Miraculous Cure.</strong></em> Characters who spend any time watching the beggars coming and going notice on a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check vs DC 13 notice a hunchback beggar entering the poorhouse and, then leaving moments later cured of his deformity!</p>

          <p><em><strong>Secret: The List.</strong></em>Characters making passive Wisdom (Perception) check vs DC 15 notice the building listing a little towards the rear of the house. </p>

          <p><em><strong>Secret: The Hidden Shaft.</strong></em> In King Sam's "throne room" there is an innocuous looking fireplace. On closer inspection the chimney stack has fallen through leaving a shaft leading to a hidden basement which is being used by smugglers. Anyone searching the room to will find it on a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check vs DC 15.</p>

          <h4 id="smugglers-hideout">2. The Smuggler's Hideout</h4>

          <p>If the players climb down the chimney stack they arrive at the smuggler's hideout. Its pitch black but if the characters have a light source read the following:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>This small, damp room is stacked with boxes. Some of the crates are smashed, and bottles of spirits and other contraband spill out. A man lies dead in a pool of blood in the middle of the room</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p><em><strong>The Corpse</strong></em> The man is not Crawface, but a smuggler killed by a series of knife wounds to the stomach. Searching his body uncovers a folded piece of paper wrapping 9 gp. The piece of paper is a map of the smuggling route through the sewers and offers advantage on sewer crawl checks to escape the sewers.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Box of Rats.</strong></em> A passive Wisdom (Perception) check vs DC 10 indicates scratching noises from one box. If the characters open it two rats spill out and attempt to run to the hidden tunnel behind the boxes.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Secret: Hidden Booty.</strong></em> A successful Intelligence (Investigation) check vs DC 20 uncovers a hidden of 9 bottles of fine brandy worth 10 gp each, hidden in a crate.</p>

        </div>
      </ink-page>

      <ink-page class="content">
        <div class="columns">

          <p><em><strong>Secret: Hidden Tunnel.</strong></em> Intelligence (Investigation) vs DC 15 to spot a trail of blood leading here:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>A rough tunnel is hidden behind a stack of crates, formed by pulling down the ancient bricks of the basement wall. The trail of blood leads into its shadowy recesses. The sound of trickling water comes from beyond.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <h4 id="dismas-sewers">2. Dismas' Sewers</h4>

          <p>The party find themselves in the city <strong>sewers</strong> and can attmept to follow the trail of blood. Use the ryles for city crawling (se page XX).</p>

          <h4 id="old-spits-nest">4. Old Spit's Nest</h4>

          <p>Old Spit's nest is the domain of the vermus. Random encounters here are always 1d4 vermus.</p>

              <h5>Hidden Fall</h5>
              <p>Medium Mechanical Trap (200 XP)</p>
            </header>

            <p>This section of the sewers is covered in refuse, concealing an open hole covered by weakened boards and a sackcloth blanket. The boards will give way if players step on them.</p>

            <p>A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns the shape of the blanket where it has been disturbed by vermus coming and going from the nest. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of the floor is actually the cover of a hole.</p>

            <p>When a creature steps on the boards, they break, causing the the intruder to spill into the 20 foot pit below, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage and landing in area 4B.</p>

          </div>

          <h5 id="bottom-of-pit">4B. Bottom of the Pit</h5>

          <p>Climbing back up their sheer surface of the hole back to the sewers requires a DC 20 Strength (Athletics). A failed check means the character gets halfway up the wall before losing their grip and falling 10 feet (1d6 bludgeoning damage). Climbing down is easier, only required a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.</p>

          <p>At the bottom of the pit is pool about 1 foot deep filled with brackish, stagnant water, Various tunnels line the bottom of the pit. From within can be heard the distant sounds of scratches and rat-like chittering.</p>

          <h5 id="warrens">4C. Warrens</h5>

          <p>If the party enters warrens via the tunnels in area 4A they start the Warren Crawling challenge.</p>

          <div class="aside" id="warren-crawling">
            <header>

            </header>

            <p>The party attempt to sneak through the narrow vermus warrens without attracting attention.</p>

            <p><strong>Success (3): </strong> The party manages to reach their desired destination, or a random one if they're exploring (see table below). Each time they attempt to explore the warren they gain a +1 on the random nest destination roll.</p>

            <p><strong>Failure: </strong> The party end attract the attention of the vermus, are swarmed and dragged to area 4F to be interrogated by Old Spit.</p>

            <p><strong><em>Dexterity (Sneak) DC 15.</em></strong> The party attempt to sneak through the warrens without attracting the attention of the vermus. Creatures wearing heavy armour roll with disadvantage. On a failure the party are attacked by 1d4 <strong>vermus</strong>. Players must declare single-file marching order, and the DM chooses whether characters at the rear of front of the line are attacked.</p>

            <p><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> Casting <em>sleep</em> or <em>charm person</em> grants an automatic success as you enchant your way past vermus sentries.</p>

          <h5 id="temple-spring">4D. Temple Spring</h5>

          <p>The ancient spring was once a Lythic temple. Water trickles down the walls and collect in a ceremonial pool. It is refreshing and drinkable.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>This is a small 20 foot by 30 foot room. It appears to be some kind of small shrine, and at one end it what appears to be a small statue of some forgotten god. Water trickles down the walls and collect in a ceremonial pool. Before the shrine is an alter covered in what appears to be rubbish.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p><em><strong>The Choir of Men.</strong></em> A shrine has been built here where the crazed vermus wrack, Scratch, and his fanatical followers have hidden away to worship the civilisation of men. At first, they prostrate themselves in front of the players. Scratch will make a big fuss of showing characters his collection of "relics" (human rubbish, including an old boot, a rusty bucket and a filthy child's doll). They will not betray the nest but they may help the party in other ways.</p>

          <p>The party can take a short rest here without triggering a random encounter. If the party attempt to leave, Scratch becomes rabid and they vermus attack. Scratch will attempt to escape when the other members of the choir are killed.</p>

          <p>This is the lair of Old Spit, the rat king. Read the following to the players:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>The weak light pours out beyond the doorway, revealing a shadowy bathhouse of Old Imperial design. From the shadows many pairs bright eyes glint, regarding you with inhuman malevolence.</p>

            <p>A shaft of light comes from above. Dangling in the light, wrapped in chains, in the body of your erstwhile companion, Clawface. Blood drips from his body into the fetid bath below. </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Old Spit will not attack at first, instead demanding to know why the party have entered his kingdom. The party can attempt to parlay with Old Spit, who may let them leave with Crawfaces body. If they do leave with him alive, he warns them not to reveal the presence of the vermus.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Crawface.</strong></em> Crawface body hangs from a chain, which is in turn attached to a grate. The grate leads out of the sewers to the surface. Crawface is, unfortunately, dead, killed by the vermus because he trespassed on Old Spit's kingdom (the sewers). His body carries a <em>bag of holding</em> <!-- too magical? --> containing 5 rubies worth 50 gp each.</p>

          <p>If the players enter the bathhouse read the following:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Your light passes over ancient mosaic frescoes, depicting old Imperial men and women cavorting with rat like beings.</p>

          <h4 id="agata">Sergeant Agata</h4>

          <p>Sergeant Agata and her mute bodyguard, Corporal Loth, are pariahs. Nominally in charge of the fetches, Agata is obsessed with conspiracies within the Griffin Company. Her brusque manner doesn't win her any friends either.</p>

          <h4 id="hyde">Corporal Hyde</h4>

          <p>Despite his lazy attitude, Hyde remains favoured of the fetches. Somehow he, and his team of spies, cutthroats  and knaves, always seems to come through with the goods. To look at the man you would not understand why: short, fat, balding. Hyde is obviously past his prime, seemingly always out of breath and covered in a sheen of sweat. Yet, as soon as he flashes his winning smile, all that is forgotten, his silver tongue getting out of all kinds of mischief.</p>

          <p>The reasons for Hyde's success is simple: he's completely corrupt. His many successes are the result of playing both sides off against each other. The only reasons he gets away with it is because he's Lieutenant Vins' brother!</p>

He is often surrounded by his entourage of clerks.</p>
          <p>Despite being a non-combatant, Walter is probably the second most important person in the Company next to Larke. Although, to his chagrin, rarely gets credit. Walter maintains the Charter (as one of the few people who can read and write) as well as handling the Company coffers as bursar. This means he knows all the company's dirty secrets.</p>

          <p>The Commonwealth Army is the main military force of the Peasant's Commonwealth.</p>

          <p><em><strong><q>For the Folk</q>.</strong></em> The rallying cry of the Commonwealth.</p>

          <p><strong><em>The Peasant King.</em></strong> Initially a term of contempt, the Peasant King adopts this title with pride. A humble man with a vision, he lead the initial republican uprising and now, reluctantly, commands the Republic.</p>

          <p><em><strong>New Model Army.</strong></em> The Commonwealth Army is unlike any army to come before. Its ranksvare made up of common-folk who took up arms to protect the Commonwealth against its Royalist enemies. Farmhands rub shoulders with seamstresses, burghers with mothers, some still suckling their babes.</p>

          <p>Most often, protection comes in the form of violence. The true heroes of the communes are the blocs: gangs of street fighters who don their signature face scarves so they can anonymously protect the most vulnerable citizens of Dismas.</p>

          <h4>Father John</h4>

          <p>The rebellion would be nothing without the support of vocal clergymen, lead by the fanatic, John(?). Rumours abound of the miracles John performs, such is his fanatical devotion to the father. There is an uneasy alliance between the increasing fanaticism of the rebel priests and the peasant factions.</p>

          <p>Mina is a Commonwealth spy operating out of Dismas and worshipper of the New Faith. She suffers terrible skin burns all over her body, so she keeps completely covered. Mina has a secret past as an ex-Royalist soldier. She put down many peasant revolutions for the nobility, so makes amends now by serving the Commonwealth, distributing political propaganda and spying.</p>

A creature that uses its action to examine the item can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check DC 13, dispelling the item.

          <p>The Inverted Ones (or <q>Inverti</q>) are a secretive cabal of academics, monks, merchants and nobles who study the occult arts.</p>

          <p><em><strong>The Secret Masters.</strong></em> The Inverti are directed by an even shadowy group of masters. No member of the Inverti has seen a master, as they communicate exclusively via <em>sending</em> spells. All that is known is that they display a powerful knowledge of magic which they offer to share in exchange for carrying out strange, esoteric tasks. These missions are often extremely obscure, even random but invariably related to collecting a piece of occult lore. They seem especially interesting in the Knothic Cache protected by the Black Griffin Company.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Freedom of Inquiry.</strong></em> All Inverti desire the freedom to study whatever subject they please, indeed to do as they please without the religious and moral restrictions places on them.</p>

            <h3 id="thieves-council">The Thieves Council</h3>
            <p><em>Faction (level 1-4, hard)</em></p>
          </header>

          <p><strong><q>Thieves' Council</q></strong> is a name you only hear in whispers, if at all. This alliance of blackguards, scoundrels and rogues has disbanded and reformed many times over the centuries. Most believe its just a legend but the word on the street is that it is very much alive.</p>

          <p>Yet no one claims membership. The city watch will assure you it cannot exist. And the Council take great pains to ensure its name never reaches the ears of anyone in real authority. Indeed, The Guild (as it is sometimes called) is known exclusively to the common folk, and then only by reputation.</p>

          <p>And a fearsome reputation it has. The thief kings and queens are infamous for their violence. They rule their night empires through intimidation and fear. Those who cross them are often the victims of threats and vicious beatings.</p>

          <p>The worst offenders simply disappear. Forever.</p>

          <p><strong><em>The Fourth Estate.</em></strong> The thief kings and queens pride themselves on being able to act where princes, popes and proctors cannot. Where the stifling rules of lawful society block or impede, the thieves can step in to smooth the way. Most merchants turn to the council when they need to move certain goods across borders. The common folk can often find justice with the thieves when common law fails them.</p>

          <p>And the Guild usually obliges... for a price.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Uneasy Alliance.</em></strong> The Council is divided into jurisdictions, each ruled by a thief king or queen. Rumours hint that they gather each year to negotiate agreements and iron out differences, so as to keep the peace between thieves. If true, such a meeting would be a true nexus of misrule and evil and a strike here could do a serious blow to the Guild.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Law of Tithe.</em></strong> The Council always gets its cut. All members must tithe one tenth (10%) of any ill-gotten gains to their thief king or queen. Failure to do so (and getting caught) often results in a severe beating. No one hears from those who get caught a second time.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Thieves' Sign and Mark.</em></strong> Council members can make themselves known to each other by a discreet Thieves Cant hand sign. Council safe houses and hangouts are also marked with a special Thieves' Mark.</p>

          <h4>Beliefs and Goals</h4>

          <p>While it might seem absurd for criminals to abide by a set of laws, the <q>Thieves Code</q> plays an important role in keeping the peace (somewhat) between thieves. and prevents crime from getting out of hand and attracting the attention of the authorities and irate mobs</p>

          <p><strong>The Black Law.</strong> Keep the council&#39;s existence a secret at all costs. (Chaotic)</p>

          <p><strong>The White Law.</strong> Abiding by the Thieves Code guarantees respect within and without the council (Lawful)</p>

          <p><strong>The Red Law.</strong> When respect fails, the bloody fist works. (Evil)</p>

            <p>Whiterock is an islet that sits just off the coast of the Coves. Its treacherous white cliffs rise out of the grey waters of the Eastern Sea.<p>

            <p>A small village perches precariously up one steep bank. You spy various fishing boats moored at the base.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>To access the islet you must either gain passage on a ferry (1gp per person) or wait for low tide to cross via the passage (see below).</p>

          <h5 id="the-red-castle">The Red Castle</h5>

          <p>This tavern sits across the bay, the last stop before Whiterock proper. Popular with the handful of <q>mainlanders</q> who find Whiterock too... strange.</p>

          <blockquote><p>Just before the road reaches its end at the shores of the Eastern Sea you find a small inn. Outside hangs a sign depicting a ruined castle, rivulets of blood streaming from it walls.</p></blockquote>

          <p><em><strong>Warnings.</strong></em> Most of the locals here will warn the party against tarrying too long amongst the strange inhabitants of Whiterock. If pressed for more information, they make the witch's sign and speak no more.</p>

          <h5 id="whiterock-passage">The Passage</h5>

            <p><em>Settlement (City)</em></p>
          </header>

          <p>Ancient Dismas huddles against the cold shores of the Western Sea. In it's warren of streets, knaves rub shoulders with carousing nobles. Slums squat in the shadows of it's looming cathedral. And merchants from across the world hawk their dubious wares.</p>

          <p><em><strong>The City of Thieves.</strong></em> Despite being one of the poorest cities in all the Land, Dismas attracts a constant stream of migrants. Many are ex-farmers from even poorer, rural areas who come to the city looking for work. And like like flies around shit, so too come the thieves. The city fathers try to keep the poorest citizens within the outer city.</p>

          <p>Yet, despite the best attempts by the Watch, the poor folk seems to seep through the Inner Wall. Slums grow like weeds everywhere. Beggars cry for alms in the shadows of the Great Cathedral. And pickpockets are a constant problem.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Ancient Metropolis.</strong></em> Dismas has existed for as long as there have been men (and perhaps before even then). It's decrepit, rotten tenements pile on top of foundations and ruins of older buildings. If you dig deep enough, crumbling bricks of the modern era give way to the stone of the city's ancient Imperial past.</p>

          <p><em><strong>The Powder Keg.</strong></em> While the advance of the Commonwealth Army has been halted, word of the peasant rebellion has not. The swelling ranks of the poor and destitute whisper of dissent. Such talk is brutally suppressed and anyone found spreading sedition are hung as traitors, burned as heretics, or simply disappeared.</p>

          <p>Yet even these draconian measures cannot fully suppress the flourishing communal spirits of the city's poorest. Each day revolt seems to draw ever closer, striking fear and fury into the hearts of the city fathers.</p>

          <p>This sprawling warren of slums sits outside the inner city, north of Barrowgate. In centuries past, this was the name of literal hill where the city's dead were interred. Being the least desirable area, yet nearest the city, it attracted the poorest of the city folk.</p>

          <p>Now, the actual cemetery is tiny part of the district. Cemetery Hill itself is a massive sprawl of shanties, hovels, and work houses that makes up the greater part of the city. Poverty is rife, beggars are everywhere. The only industries that thrive are the foulest, smelliest ones that would not be tolerated behind the city walls.</p>

          <p>On first appearances, The Annie House appears to be a workhouse for young girls and women that launders clothing. In reality, it's a front for a Commonwealth Army spy ring (see page <ink-page-ref ref="commonwealth-army"></ink-page-ref>).</p>

          <h6 id="annie-house-main-entrance">1.1. Main Entrance</h6>

          <p>Read the following:</p>

          <blockquote><p>The grand, double-gated entrance to the Annie House stands at the end of a long alleyway. Tenements stand either side, so tall and decrepit they seem to about to fall on you.</p></blockquote>

          <p>The main entrance gate is normally kept unlocked. 4 <strong>bloc toughs</strong> (see page <ink-page-ref ref="bloc-tough"></ink-page-ref>) hide in watch from the rooftops of the surrounding tenements.</p>

          <p>If fighting starts they are joined in two rounds by 4 more <strong>bloc toughs</strong> from area 1.9.</p>

          <h6 id="annie-house-rear-yard">1.2. Rear Yard</h6>

          <p>Read the following:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>You make your way from the cobbled streets, down some slippery stairs to a large yard. The rears of several houses tower around, creating a secluded area.</p>

            <p>Before you is the rear of the Annie House, stairs leading up to a small door. </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p><em><strong>Stray dogs.</strong></em> 4 <strong>mastiffs</strong> fight over an dead rat here. They attack if disturbed, otherwise they ignore the party.</p>

          <h6 id="annie-house-rear-entrance">1.3. Rear Entrance</h6>

          <p>Read the following:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>You find yourself in front of a sturdy looking door. There is a small grate at eye height. </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p><em><strong>Old Maid.</strong></em> A forgetful old woman guards the doorway. She must be convinced to allow anyone to enter the premises (DC 15, with disadvantage for men).</p>

          <p>Read the following:</p>

          <blockquote><p>You find yourself in a large, inner yard. The walls of the Annie House rise all around you. White blankets and clothes hang from clotheslines</p></blockquote>

          <p>Normally "annies" - washerwomen - can be found here busily washing and drying large, white sheets.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Drying Sheets.</strong></em> The drying sheets in this area over advantage to any creature hiding in this area. It takes two actions to tear down the sheets and remove this advantage.</p>

          <h6 id="annie-house-store-cupboard">1.5. Store Cupboard</h6>

          <p>This dingy store cupboard is piled high with cleaning tools. An old rug in a corner is actually a badly disguised trap door leading to area 1.6. It requires a Wisdom (Investigation) check vs DC 12 to find. A passive Wisdom (Perception) check of 12 will reveal that a corner of the rug is folded up.</p>

          <h6 id="annie-house-basement">1.6. Basement</h6>

          <p>This area is the secret basement of the Annie House. The area is dark and dusty, with thin walls made of crumbling bricks.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Bricked Up Door.</strong></em> A passive Wisdom (Perception) check vs DC 12 (with disadvantage with low light) is required to spot that bricks in one part of the wall seem newer. Pulling down the bricks reveals an entrance to room 1.10.</p>

          <p>This room contains large piles of paper, ink and wood presses for the printing of various revolutionary, political tracts. Subjects include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>The Blue-Blooded Bastard.</strong> About the illegitimacy of the current royal heir.</li>
            <li><strong>The Labours of Women.</strong> A list of the many uncompensated jobs of women.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>All are beautifully illustrated by Mina.</p>

          <h6 id="annie-house-secret-exit">1.9. Bloc Forum</h6>

          <p>This room is centered around a large table. If the party aren't expected, a lively debate is ensuing here. Mina and 4 <strong>bloc toughs</strong> can be found here.</p>

          <h6 id="annie-house-secret-exit">1.10. Harry's Tomb</h6>

          <p>This room contains a long-dead body. A sign with the writing "Harry the Ravisher" is hung about his neck. He is the ex-owner of the Annie House. Killed for abusing his trust.</p>

          <h6 id="grave-of-st-john">The Grave of St. John</h6>

          <p>Buried in a random grave lies the remains of St. John. This includes the fabled relic, The Crown of St. John, hidden here by the Monks of Ancelier.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Marked Grave</strong></em> St Johns is buried in the grave of <q>Anna</q>, a maid who died a century from now. However, the grave is marked with a strange symbol: A holy cross, contained within a circle, the mark of the Monks of Ancelier. Creatures searching the area for clues must make a Wisdom (Investigation) or Intelligence (Religion) DC 20 check to spot the unusually marked grave</p>

              <p><em>Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)</em></p>
            </header>

              <p>This grisly relic is the skull of St. John, a fierce warrior of the faith. St. John was beheaded and martyred by the enemies of the Church. By a miracle his head continued to speak, even after death, so the faithful carefully collected and preserved it.</p>

              <p>The Crown can be used as a holy symbol for divine spellcasters. As an action, the wielder of the Crown can also present it and speak a prayer censuring evil spirits. Each evil spirit (fey, outsider or undead) that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned as undead for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. See the Cleric's <q>Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</q> class feature in Chapter 3 of the <em>Player's Guide</em> for more information on turning.</p>

              <p>To use the Crown's turning ability you must complete a long rest.</p>

              <p>In addition, The Head of St. John will speak out to aid anyone carrying it during combat. While carrying the Head of St. John you can use your reaction to attempt to block a melee attack. Make a Dexterity saving throw, on a success you do not take any damage.</p>

          <p>Once a sleepy way-stop, Barnstable has become the <em>Town Requisitioned</em> and is now controlled by Royalist forces. Great walls are being hastily constructed around the town, and caravans and carts leave regularly running supplies to and from The Front.</p>

          <h5>The Three Fellows</h5>

          <p>Once a popular inn, The Three Fellows has been turned into a Royalist depot. Harried officers organise the complicated network of supply routes.</p>

          <p>Fort Finy is an old tower that has been turned into a secret prisoner of war camp.</p>

          <p>This wooden gate is the only entrance to the Fort. It has seen better days an is the weak point (AC 13, 20 hp).</p>

          <blockquote><p>A solid wooden gate stands two spans overhead.</p></blockquote>

          <h5>2. Yard</h5>
          <blockquote>

            <p>The muddy yard is surrounded by the decrepit battlements of the fort. A group of soldiers huddle in one corner, covered in blankets, noisily snoring. A guard lazily patrols the walls above.</p>
            <p>The main tower looms, unsteadily. Entrance is acquired via a sturdy door at the top of a set of precarious stone steps.</p>

            <p>A stable has been shoddily constructed on the north side. A couple of wretched-looking horses whiny at you, then go back to gnawing on hay.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p><em><strong>Exits.</strong></em> Entrance to the keep first floor can be acquired via a set of precarious stone steps that lead up from this area. The entrance to the keep dungeon is a sturdy door at the foot of these steps, always kept locked.</p>

      </ink-page>

      <ink-page class="content appendix">
        <div class="columns">

          <p>This section includes various skill challenges useful in the cutthroat world of Black Griffin. Rules for skill challenges can be found in <em>Skill Challenges</em>, also published by Grisly Eye Games.</p>

          <header id="interrogation-skill-challenge">
            <h4>Interrogation</h4>
            <p><em>Skill Challenge (level 1-4, difficulty varies)</em></p>
          </header>

          <p>The Land is at war, but it is like no war before it. Where once battles were won by the sharpest blade or most courageous will, secrets and lies are now deciding factors. So the ability to extract information from unwilling prisoners is vital. In addition to arsenals or pistols, infantry and armour, moden armies also have spies and interrogators skilled in the arts of torture.</p>

          <p><strong>Success (3):</strong> You gain the information you desire. If you allow the target to rest before you gain all successes they lose all exhaustion levels but you lose all successes (but not failures!).</p>

          <p><strong>Failure:</strong> You gain incorrect or misleading information. If this information is vital to the success of the mission, you fail that mission.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Charisma (Deception, Intimidation or Persuasion) vs target's Wisdom:</em></strong> By keeping the target awake and asking hard questions, or attempting to deceive them you can find out additional information. You must make this check with disadvantage. Each time a character uses this check the target looses a level of exhaustion.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Strength (Intimidation) or Charisma (Persuasion) vs target's Wisdom:</em></strong> By torturing the victim you can more easily acquire information. You may make this check with advantage. However, each time a character uses this check the target looses <em>two</em> levels of exhaustion and takes 1d8 damage.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Torturer's Tools vs target's Wisdom:</em></strong> With judicious use of torturer's tools, you can cause maximum pain with minimal actual physical damage. Unlike manual torture, each time a character uses this check the target looses a level of exhaustion.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Spells</em></strong> Casting <em>charm person</em> grants an automatic success.</p>

          <header id="negotiation-skill-challenge">
            <h4>Negotiation</h4>
            <p><em>Skill Challenge (level 1-4, difficulty varies)</em></p>
          </header>

          <p>A mercenary's life is all about haggling: the price of a weapon, how much to bribe, the value of a contract. The DM starts negotiations by declaring the amount of money to your opponent desires.</p>

          <p><strong>Success:</strong> Each success increases/decreases the price by 10% in a way favourable to the party.</p>

          <p><strong>Failure:</strong> Each failure increases/decreases the price by 10% in a way favourable to the opponents of the skill challenge.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Charisma (Intimidation, Persuasion or Deception) vs target's passive Wisdom (Insight):</strong></em> By using threats, praise or lies you attempt to bring the price down. Characters should tread carefully at the start of a negotiation. If the party offend an opponent in a negotiation, or the opponent is hostile, all Charisma checks have disadvantage for the first round.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Spells</em></strong> Casting <em>charm person</em> grants an automatic success. At the DM's discretion, an illusion spell like <em>arcanist's magic aura</em> could also grant an automatic success.</p>

            <h4>Preparing for Battle</h4>
            <p><em>Skill Challenge (level 1-4, medium)</em></p>
          </header>

          <p>Inevitably, in Black Griffin, the characters will find themselves preparing their own troops for battle.</p>

          <p><strong>Success:</strong> There is no success condition for this skill challenge. Instead you get a number of challenge rounds in which to roll and increase your odds of success during the final melee.<p>

            <p>You get three rounds per day. One for each quarter of the day, morning, afternoon and evening but excluding night. You can work through the night, but each night worked costs a level of exhaustion for you and your troops.</p>

          <p><strong>Failure:</strong> There is no failure outcome for this challenge, other than you remain woefully unprepared for the coming battle.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) DC 15:</em></strong> You use your leadership skills to motivate your troops to perform one of the following tasks:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong><em>Training.</em></strong> Through rigorous drilling and practice you train your troops for combat. Each success gives you one Leadership Point that can be spent to give your troops advantage on one attack roll, ability check or saving throw during combat. You can only spend a Leadership Point on a unit that can hear you.</li>

            <li><strong><em>Construction.</em></strong> You direct your troops to dig out trenches, build walls etc. See the siege equipment section for details on the time and costs to build each type of fortification.</li>

        <h3>Coming Soon</h3>

          <h4>Thanks</h4>

          <p>The layout and style of this monograph was based on the <strong>Dungeon Masters Guild</strong> <em>Adventure Template</em>. The main font is <em>Alegreya</em> by Juan Pablo del Peral which is more elegant and legible than the template default. It is also hosted on Google Webfonts and supports "true" italics and bold. The title font was <em>Andada SC</em>.</p>

          <p>This document was published using HTML, JavaScript and CSS, and composed using open source, web technologies including Node.js, Grunt, NPM, Bower, SASS, Polymer and Yarn. The PDF was generated using Chrome's PDF print preview feature. The monster stat blocks were generated using a web component of my own creation, based on Val Markovic's open source <em>Statblock5e</em>.</p>

          <p>I'd also like to thank our playtesters, including:</p>
