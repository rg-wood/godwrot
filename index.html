        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <div class="columns">

          <p>Black Griffin is a gritty, low-magic, setting neutral campaign where the characters are members of a shady mercenary company.</p>

          <p>This book should be accompanied by a copy of the <em>Black Griffon Player's Guide</em> (available for free from <em>Grisly Eye Games</em>) which you can give to your players. It includes the rules for making characters for this campaign, as well as pre-generated characters for fast play.</p>

          <h3>Faction Escalations</h3>

          <p>Black Griffin is a campaign of intrigue and the various factions at play don't sit idly by while the party interfere with their plans. Every so often the text of the adventure will say the party have triggered an <em>escalation</em>. When this happens check an escalation box for the triggered faction. You can also trigger escalations if you judge the party have...[?]</p>

          <p>Escalations can apply a penalty to the party, such as making faction members initially hostile towards them. An escalation can also trigger a <em>faction encounter</em>.</p>
          
          <h4>Faction Encounters</h4>

          <p>When you next successfully roll for a random encounter, you can choose to run a faction encounter instead. Run through any triggered faction escalations and play an appropriate one.</p>

        <h2>Dismas</h2>

        <div class="columns">

          <!-- Renaissance version of the City of Thieves -->

          <p>Ancient Dismas, the City of Thieves, huddles against the cold shores of the Great Western Sea.</p>
          <!-- grey, stone, oppressive -->

          <p><em><strong>Uneasy Peace.</strong></em> The advance of the Common Army from the North has been halted by a shaky peace treaty. Many whisper his rule is numbered in days.</p>

          <!-- focus on faceless brutality of city watch? night vs day watch? -->

          <p><em><strong>Sectarianism.</strong></em> Currently the city is in turmoil as the followers of the Father and the Mother... Once united, the worshippers of the Father have turned on the much beleaguered sect of the Mother.</p>

          <h3>Random Encounters</h3>

          <p>Due to the hustle of the city, random encounters can occur more frequently. You should roll for every 1-2 hours.</p>

        <h2>Act I: The Spy Thieves</h2>

        <div class="columns">

          <p>In this mission, the party are asked to find the whereabouts of Vyncent, a Griffon Company spy who was, until recently, providing valuable information.</p>

          <p>Read the following to the party:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>The Black Griffin Company is on the march. It's mission, to reinforce the royalist frontline north of the ancient city of Dismas.</p>

            <!-- players confused that Vyncent is a spy -->
            <p>A company spy, Vyncent, was  sent ahead to Dismas to gather information. However, he has since gone missing. Your squadron has been sent ahead to find out what happened.</p>

            <p>His last known whereabouts: a poorhouse in the slum, Cemetery Hill.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <!-- Lead into the action faster: confusing beginning with no obvious things to do. -->

          <p>The party should find the poorhouse with little trouble.</p>

          <h3>1. The Poorhouse</h3>

          <p>Read the following:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>You can smell the rickety, poorhouse before you see it. Rough looking beggars and tramps come and go constantly, or linger outside.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>The poorhouse is actually a front for a smuggling operation in-and-out of the city. A hole in a fallen-through chimney stack leads to a hidden basement. However, the baggars won't just tell strangers about it.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Old Sam (Choleric, Suspicious).</strong></em> Old Sam "leads" the beggars at the poorhouse. If the players start asking questions he will be pointed out to them. If they make trouble, he comes out to investigate. He has a heavy cough caused by the black mold in his "throne room" (Intelligence (Medicine) check vs DC15 to diagnose). If they players can convince him he will reveal the smugglers den beneath the poorhouse.</p>

          <p>Characters who spend any time watching the beggars coming and going notice on a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check vs DC 13 notice a hunchback beggar entering the poorhouse and, then leaving moments later cured of his deformity!</p>

          <p>Characters making passive Wisdom (Perception) check vs DC 15 notice the building listing a little towards the rear of the house. </p>

      <ink-page class="content">

        <div class="columns">
          <h3>2. The Smuggler's Hideout</h3>

          <p>If the players climb down the chimney stack they arrive at the smuggler's hideout. Its pitch black but if the characters have a light source read the following:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>This small, damp room stacked with boxes. Some of the crates are smashed, and bottles of spirits and other contraband spill out. A man lies dead in a pool of blood in the middle of the room</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p><em><strong>The Corpse</strong></em> The man is not Vyncent, but a smuggler killed by a series of knife wounds to the stomach. Searching his body uncovers a folded piece of paper wrapping 9 gp. The piece of paper is a map of the smuggling route through the sewers and offers advantage on sewer crawl checks to escape the sewers.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Box of Rats.</strong></em> A passive Wisdom (Perception) check vs DC 10 indicates scratching noises from one box. If the characters open it two rats spill out.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Hidden Booty.</strong></em> On a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check vs DC 20 uncovers a hidden of 9 lapis lazuli gems worth 10 gp each, hidden in a crate.</p>

          <p>Two vermus spies lie in watch in the shadows.</p>

          <!-- Needs third exit option? -->

          <h4>Hidden Tunnel</h4>

          <p>Intelligence (Investigation) vs DC 15 to spot a trail of blood leading to this:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>A rough tunnel is hidden behind the creates, formed by pulling down the ancient bricks of the basement wall. A putrid smell emanates. The trail of blood leads into its shadowy recesses. The sound of trickling water comes from beyond.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <h3>2. Dismas' Sewers</h3>

          <blockquote>
            <p>The first thing that greats you as you enter the sewers is, of course, the foul smell. Sewers smell, you suppose, but to encounter the reality is quite something else.</p>

            <p>Secondly, the darkness consumes you, setting nerves on edge. Thirdly the sound of running water echoes </p>

          <h3>4. Old Spit's Nest</h3>

          <p>Old Spit's nest is the domain of the vermus. Random encounters here are always 1d4 vermus.</p>

          <h4>4A. Nest Entrance</h4>

              <h4>Hidden Fall</h4>
              <p>Medium Mechanical Trap (200 XP)</p>
            </header>

            <p>This section of the sewers is covered in refuse, concealing an open hole covered by weakened boards and a sackcloth blanket. The boards will give way if players step on them.</p>

            <p>A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns the shape of the blanket where it has been disturbed by vermus coming and going from the nest. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of the floor is actually the cover of a hole.</p>

            <p>When a creature steps on the boards, they break, causing the the intruder to spill into the 20 foot pit below, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage and landing in area 4B.</p>

          </div>

          <h4>4B. Bottom of the Pit</h4>

          <p>Climbing back up their sheer surface of the hole back to the sewers requires a DC 20 Strength (Athletics). A failed check means the character gets halfway up the wall before losing their grip and falling 10 feet (1d6 bludgeoning damage). Climbing down is easier, only required a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.</p>
          
          <p>At the bottom of the pit is pool about 1 foot deep filled with brackish, stagnant water, Various tunnels line the bottom of the pit. From within can be heard the distant sounds of scratches and rat-like chittering.</p>

          <h4>4C. Warrens</h4>

          <p>If the party enters warrens via the tunnels in area 4A they start the Warren Crawling challenge.</p>

            </header>

            <p>The party attempt to sneak through the narrow vermus warrens without attracting attention.</p>

            <p><strong>Success (3): </strong> The party manages to reach their desired destination, or a random one if they're exploring (see table below). Each time they attempt to explore the warren they gain a +1 on the random nest destination roll.</p>

            <p><strong>Failure: </strong> The party end attract the attention of the vermus, are swarmed and dragged to area 4F to be interrogated by Old Spit.</dd>

            <p><strong><em>Dexterity (Sneak) DC 15.</em></strong> The party attempt to sneak through the warrens without attracting the attention of the vermus. Creatures wearing heavy armour roll with disadvantage. On a failure the party are attacked by 1d4 <strong>vermus</strong>. Players must declare single-file marching order, and the DM chooses whether characters at the rear of front of the line are attacked.</p>

            <p><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> Casting <em>sleep</em> or <em>charm person</em> grants an automatic success as you enchant your way past vermus sentries.</p>

          <p>The ancient spring was once a Lythic temple. Water trickles down the walls and collect in a ceremonial pool. It is refreshing and drinkable.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>This is a small 20 foot by 30 foot room. It appears to be some kind of small shrine, and at one end it what appears to be a small statue of some forgotten god.

          <!-- The approach to the city -->

          <blockquote>
            <p>Recently your erstwhile comrade-in-arms, Crawface, deserted with a whole squadron. Your mission is to capture and return him for a bounty of 140 gold pieces. You only get half if he's dead.</p>

            <p>You believe you&#39;ve tracked them to a seedy tavern near the docks, <em>The Five Maids</em>. You watch the tavern from the shadows of a nearby alley under cover of night and a heavy rainstorm. As thunder rolls in the distance, you ponder you first move. What will you do?</p>
          </blockquote>

          <h3>Scene 1. The Five Maids</h3>
          <!-- Five Maids -> The Gulls -->

          <p><strong>The Five Maids</strong> is a rough establishment, named after the five fair wenches that serve its watery ale. Here you&#39;ll find hardy sailors, weary old men and other misfits who come for the ask-no-questions atmosphere and cheap drink.</p>

          <p>On the first floor are several small rooms for rent. Covered in sawdust and straw, they can be rented for 1 gp a night as long as you don&#39;t mind sharing a squalid floor with ten other rough sleepers.</p>

          <p>The five maids themselves do everything: serve food and drinks, cook and clean, and throw rowdier elements out if needed.</p>

          <p><em>Big Frey</em> speaks for the five maids and serves behind the counter. This stout, young women has a thick head of unruly red hair and a temper to match.</p>

          <p><strong>The Innkeeper Lies Beneath (Secret)</strong> Whilst most patrons remember <strong>Old Ben</strong>, the innkeeper, they haven&#39;t seen him in a while. That&#39;s because the five maids, sick of his foul temper, murdered him one night and buried his body in the basement. For this reason, they don&#39;t let strangers down to the basement and are apt to change the subject if Old Ben comes up in conversation.</p>

          <p><strong>If the players wait to see what happens</strong> read the following:</p>

          <blockquote>
          <p>You stand for a while in the cold, wet alleyway. Your boots fill with water and you begin to shiver, but your patience is rewarded. Eventually several figures leave the tavern and move to an alleyway nearby. You instantly recognise several of the party: it is your quarry, the deserters!</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Move to scene 2.</p>

          <p><strong>If the players enter the tavern</strong> read the following:</p>

          <!-- add random drunk encounter as they enter the tavern: someone is getting thrown out -->
          <blockquote>
          <p>As you open the double doors you are overwhelmed by the warm stench of unwashed human bodies and stale ale. The tavern is busy tonight and the bawdy music playing is drowned out by the murmurs of the dishevelled and seedy patrons, chatting, gambling and drinking amongst themselves.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>The deserters are spread out across the room amidst the patrons.</p>

          <p><strong>Players must make a passive perception check versus a DC 15 to spot the deserters</strong> amidst the crowd.</p>

          <p><strong>If the first players look out of place</strong> i.e. wealthy, fey (dwarf of elf) etc., <strong>they lose surprise.</strong> Read the following:</p>

          <blockquote>
          <p>As you step past the bar the inn suddenly falls silent. Heads turn and red-rimmed eyes glare at you. Slowly, the low murmur returns, the bard in the corner continues to play and every turns back to what they were doing.</p>
          </blockquote>

        </div>
      </ink-page>

      <ink-page class="content">
        <div class="columns">

          <p>The deserters immediately realise they&#39;ve been found and start to slowly make their way to the exit.</p>

          <p><strong>Allow the players an additional passive perception check versus a DC 10 to spot the deserters</strong> trying to sneak past player character through the crowd.</p>

          <p><strong>If the players ask Big Frey</strong> about a man with a scar on his face <strong>and succeed a Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check versus DC 15</strong> (advantage with a 1 gp or more bribe, disadvantage if the players are out-of-place as above) she will claim Crawface was in earlier and identify one or two deserters in the tavern as being his comrades.</p>

          <p><strong>If the players confront the deserters they attack</strong> while the rest of the deserters try to escape to meet Crawface (scene 2): either through the door or through a window if the player&#39;s block escape. <strong>All non-finesse melee attacks are at disadvantage due to the cramped conditions of the tavern.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>If the player&#39;s do nothing after ten minutes</strong> the deserters sneak through the crowd and organise a surprise attack on the players. <!-- how to time this? --></p>

          <p>Crawface waits beneath the gallows. <strong>If the players do nothing</strong> moments later riders approach.</p>

          <blockquote>
          <p>Three armoured figures ride up, their leader bearing chains across his breast. His pale companions have the haunted expressions of thralls. You know the sign of your company&#39;s mortal enemies anywhere: these are envoys of the Chain! The nefarious slave army you thought you&#39;d left far west. The leader dismounts and clasps Crawface&#39;s arm in stern but friendly greeting.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p><strong>If the players attack Crawface immediately</strong> then wait three rounds and then:</p>

          <blockquote>
          <p>Three armoured figures ride up, their leader bearing chains across his breast. His pale companions have the haunted expressions of thralls. You know the sign of your company&#39;s mortal enemies anywhere: these are envoys of the Chain! The nefarious slave army you thought you&#39;d left far west. Roaring, the leader dismounts and charges into battle.</p>

          <p>Tartius orders his thralls to flank a player and hold him. He carries a thread from the Knothic artefact, the <a href="griffin-herald.md">Black Griffin Herald</a>. We will attempt to place the thread in the victim&#39;s mouth and turn him into a Chain thrall.</p>

          <p><strong>If the players attempt to negotiate</strong> with Crawface he will hesitate. He is not adverse to the idea of surrendering at this point.</p>

          <p>Witches, magi, spirits: most sane folk consider them superstitious legends. Fortunately, the templars are crazy enough to still believe these creatures exist, gone into hiding in secret conspiracies. It is the templars ancient mission to hunt down and eradicate all magic in the world, lest it cause the Witch Kings <!-- or devil? --> to return again.</p>

          <p>The layout and style of this monograph was based on the <strong>Dungeon Masters Guild</strong> <em>Adventure Template</em>. The main font is <em>Alegreya</em> by Juan Pablo del Peral which is more elegant and legible than the template default. It is also hosted on Google Webfonts and supports "true" italics and bold. The title font was <em>Andada SC</em>.</p>

          <p>This document was published using HTML, JavaScript and CSS, and composed using open source, web technologies including Node.js, Grunt, NPM, Bower, SASS, Polymer and Yarn.

The monster stat blocks were generated using a web component of my own creation, based on Val Markovic's open source <em>Statblock5e</em>.</p>
