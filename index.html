        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <div class="columns">

          <p>Black Griffin is a gritty, low-magic, setting neutral campaign where the characters are members of a shady mercenary company.</p>

          <p>This book should be accompanied by a copy of the <em>Black Griffon Player's Guide</em> (available for free from <em>Grisly Eye Games</em>) which you can give to your players. It includes the rules for making characters for this campaign, as well as pre-generated characters for fast play.</p>

          <h3>Faction Escalations</h3>

          <p>Black Griffin is a campaign of intrigue and the various factions at play don't sit idly by while the party interfere with their plans. Every so often the text of the adventure will say the party have triggered an <em>escalation</em>. When this happens check an escalation box for the triggered faction. You can also trigger escalations if you judge the party have...[?]</p>

          <p>Escalations can apply a penalty to the party, such as making faction members initially hostile towards them. An escalation can also trigger a <em>faction encounter</em>.</p>
          
          <h4>Faction Encounters</h4>

          <p>When you next successfully roll for a random encounter, you can choose to run a faction encounter instead. Run through any triggered faction escalations and play an appropriate one.</p>

        <h2>Dismas</h2>

        <div class="columns">

          <!-- Renaissance version of the City of Thieves -->

          <p>Ancient Dismas, the City of Thieves, huddles against the cold shores of the Great Western Sea.</p>
          <!-- grey, stone, oppressive -->

          <p><em><strong>Uneasy Peace.</strong></em> The advance of the Common Army from the North has been halted by a shaky peace treaty. Many whisper his rule is numbered in days.</p>

          <!-- focus on faceless brutality of city watch? night vs day watch? -->

          <p><em><strong>Sectarianism.</strong></em> Currently the city is in turmoil as the followers of the Father and the Mother... Once united, the worshippers of the Father have turned on the much beleaguered sect of the Mother.</p>

          <h3>Random Encounters</h3>

          <p>Due to the hustle of the city, random encounters can occur more frequently. You should roll for every 1-2 hours.</p>

        <h2>The Nightmare Under Dismas</h2>

        <div class="columns">

          <p>This introductory mini-adventure introduces the setting and allows the characters to get to know each other. Read the following to the party:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>The Black Griffin Company limps towards it's newest commission: reinforcing the royalist frontline against the Commonwealth Forces.</p>

            <p>In the wake of its last defeat, dessertion is rife. You've been sent ahead to the ancient city of Dismas to capture and return your erstwhile colleague, Crawface. For this you will receive a bounty of 140 gold pieces. You only get half if he's dead.</p>

            <p>You believe you've tracked him to a seedy poorhouse in the slum, Cemetery Hill. You watch the derelict building from the shadows of a nearby alley, under cover of night. Tramps and beggars come and go, or linger outside warming themselves by street fires.</p>

            <p>What will you do?</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <!-- Lead into the action faster: confusing beginning with no obvious things to do. -->

          <p>The party should find the poorhouse with little trouble.</p>

          <h3 id="the-poorhouse">1. The Poorhouse</h3>

          <p>If the players approach the poorhouse read the following:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>You can smell the rickety, poorhouse before you approach it. The thick stench of sweat, rotten food and despair is overwhelming. All but a handful of the wretches lingering scatter as you approach. The remaining members glare balefully at you.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>The poorhouse is actually a front for a smuggling operation in-and-out of the city. However, the beggars won't just tell strangers about it.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Old Sam (Choleric, Venal).</strong></em> Old Sam is the beggar "king". If the players start asking questions he will be pointed out to them. If they make any noise (say by arguing with Three) he comes out to investigate. He will help the players in exchange for money. He has a heavy cough caused by the black mold in his "throne room" (Intelligence (Medicine) check vs DC15 to diagnose). If they players can convince him he will reveal the hidden shaft (see below).</p>

          <p><em><strong>Secret: Miraculous Cure.</strong></em> Characters who spend any time watching the beggars coming and going notice on a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check vs DC 13 notice a hunchback beggar entering the poorhouse and, then leaving moments later cured of his deformity!</p>

          <p><em><strong>Secret: The List.</strong></em>Characters making passive Wisdom (Perception) check vs DC 15 notice the building listing a little towards the rear of the house. </p>

          <p><em><strong>Secret: The Hidden Shaft.</strong></em> In Old Sam's "throne room" there is an innocuous looking fireplace. On closer inspection the chimney stack has fallen through leaving a shaft leading to a hidden basement which is being used by smugglers. Anyone searching the room to will find it on a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check vs DC 15.</p>

      <ink-page class="content">

        <div class="columns">
          <h3 id="smugglers-hideout">2. The Smuggler's Hideout</h3>

          <p>If the players climb down the chimney stack they arrive at the smuggler's hideout. Its pitch black but if the characters have a light source read the following:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>This small, damp room is stacked with boxes. Some of the crates are smashed, and bottles of spirits and other contraband spill out. A man lies dead in a pool of blood in the middle of the room</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p><em><strong>The Corpse</strong></em> The man is not Crawface, but a smuggler killed by a series of knife wounds to the stomach. Searching his body uncovers a folded piece of paper wrapping 9 gp. The piece of paper is a map of the smuggling route through the sewers and offers advantage on sewer crawl checks to escape the sewers.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Box of Rats.</strong></em> A passive Wisdom (Perception) check vs DC 10 indicates scratching noises from one box. If the characters open it two rats spill out.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Secret: Hidden Booty.</strong></em> A successful Intelligence (Investigation) check vs DC 20 uncovers a hidden of 9 bottles of fine brandy worth 10 gp each, hidden in a crate.</p>

          <h4>Hidden Tunnel</h4>

          <p>Intelligence (Investigation) vs DC 15 to spot a trail of blood leading to this:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>A rough tunnel is hidden behind the creates, formed by pulling down the ancient bricks of the basement wall. A putrid smell emanates. The trail of blood leads into its shadowy recesses. The sound of trickling water comes from beyond.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <h3 id="dismas-sewers">2. Dismas' Sewers</h3>

          <p>Read the following to the players:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>You appear to be in the fabled city sewers. What strikes you, though, is the complete lack of smell. Sewers smell, you suppose, but these tunnels just smell of damp and age.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p><em><strong>Searching the sewers.</strong></em> The party can choose to search the sewers, attempting to follow the trail of blood. Use the sewer crawling skill challenge below.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Secret: Unused Sewers</strong></em> A successful passive Intelligence (History) check vs DC 13 will let a character know that the sewers are a relic of the Old Empire and haven't been used since that ancient age. The citizens of Dismas prefer to use the streets sa their latrines these days.</p>

          <p>Old Spit's nest is the domain of the vermus. Random encounters here are always 1d4 vermus.</p>

              <p>Medium Mechanical Trap (200 XP)</p>
            </header>

            <p>This section of the sewers is covered in refuse, concealing an open hole covered by weakened boards and a sackcloth blanket. The boards will give way if players step on them.</p>

            <p>A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns the shape of the blanket where it has been disturbed by vermus coming and going from the nest. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of the floor is actually the cover of a hole.</p>

            <p>When a creature steps on the boards, they break, causing the the intruder to spill into the 20 foot pit below, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage and landing in area 4B.</p>

          </div>

          <h4 id="bottom-of-pit">4B. Bottom of the Pit</h4>

          <p>Climbing back up their sheer surface of the hole back to the sewers requires a DC 20 Strength (Athletics). A failed check means the character gets halfway up the wall before losing their grip and falling 10 feet (1d6 bludgeoning damage). Climbing down is easier, only required a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.</p>
          
          <p>At the bottom of the pit is pool about 1 foot deep filled with brackish, stagnant water, Various tunnels line the bottom of the pit. From within can be heard the distant sounds of scratches and rat-like chittering.</p>

          <h4 id="warrens">4C. Warrens</h4>

          <p>If the party enters warrens via the tunnels in area 4A they start the Warren Crawling challenge.</p>

            <p>The party attempt to sneak through the narrow vermus warrens without attracting attention.</p>

            <p><strong>Success (3): </strong> The party manages to reach their desired destination, or a random one if they're exploring (see table below). Each time they attempt to explore the warren they gain a +1 on the random nest destination roll.</p>

            <p><strong>Failure: </strong> The party end attract the attention of the vermus, are swarmed and dragged to area 4F to be interrogated by Old Spit.</dd>

            <p><strong><em>Dexterity (Sneak) DC 15.</em></strong> The party attempt to sneak through the warrens without attracting the attention of the vermus. Creatures wearing heavy armour roll with disadvantage. On a failure the party are attacked by 1d4 <strong>vermus</strong>. Players must declare single-file marching order, and the DM chooses whether characters at the rear of front of the line are attacked.</p>

            <p><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> Casting <em>sleep</em> or <em>charm person</em> grants an automatic success as you enchant your way past vermus sentries.</p>

Scratch will make a big fuss of showing characters his collection of "relics" (human rubbish, including an old boot, a rusty bucket and a filthy child's doll). They will not betray the nest but they may help the party in other ways.</p>

          <p>The party can take a short rest here without triggering a random encounter. If the party attempt to leave, Scratch becomes rabid and they vermus attack. Scratch will attempt to escape when the other members of the choir are killed.</p>
