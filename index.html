        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <div class="columns">

          <p><strong>Black Griffin</strong> is a gritty campaign where the characters are members of a shady mercenary company on the wrong side of a war. Characters will be sent on missions to chip away at enemy factions as part of a new style of play called the "faction sandbox".</p>

          <p>This book should be accompanied by a copy of the <em>Black Griffon Player's Guide</em> (available for free from <em>Grisly Eye Games</em>) which you can give to your players. It includes the rules for making characters for this campaign, as well as pre-generated characters for fast play.</p>

          <h3 id="faction-sandbox">The Faction Sandbox</h3>

          <p>After the first adventure ('The Nightmare Under Dismas') has established the setting and characters, the game turns into a faction sandbox:</p>

          <p>In a faction sandbox, at the end of each session the DM generates three new missions. The players decide amongst themselves which mission to run for the next session. The DM then turns this mission into a mini-adventure as part of his session preparation. The process is repeated for the next session after that and so on.</p>

          <p>In addition to the normal rewards and risks of adventures, missions have impacts on the wider world of factions. New factions can appear on the scene, and old factions maybe weakened or empowered by the party's actions.</p>

          <h4 id="factions">Factions</h4>

          <p>The factions sandbox builds on the rules for factions and organisations from chapter 1 of the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em>. Factions in the sandbox are described with the following additional details:</p>

          <p><em><strong>Level and Difficulty.</strong></em> A faction’s level is expressed as a range of levels to give you an idea of its relative strength (levels 1–4, 5–10, 11–16, and 17– 20).  It is then labeled as an easy, medium, or hard. The faction’s level tells you how powerful it is compared to others of its level range.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Missions.</strong></em> A random table of typical missions this faction carries out when not in direct conflict with another.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Leaders.</strong></em> A random table of the most powerful and notable members of this faction, accompanied by stat blocks for these NPCs.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Strongholds.</strong></em> A random table of locations important to this faction. These locations will be accompanied by detailed maps and notes elsewhere in the faction description.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Followers.</strong></em> A random encounter table for common members of this faction. This maybe accompanied by stat blocks for these NPCs.</p>

          <h4 id="faction-deck">The Faction Deck</h4>

          <p>The faction deck represents the balance of power between the factions in your world. The more cards a faction has, the more powerful it is. As factions expend their resources or face defeat, they lose cards. Similarly, victorious factions gain cards.</p>

          <p>The number of cards a faction has initially depends on their difficulty. When adding factions to a faction deck, refer to the Initial Faction Deck table below:</p>

          <table id="initial-faction-deck-table">
            <caption>Initial Faction Deck</caption>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Faction Difficulty</th>
                <th class="number">Initial Cards</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>

            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>Easy</td>
                <td class="number">5</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Medium</td>
                <td class="number">10</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Hard</td>
                <td class="number">15</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

          <p>You can just use index cards and write the name of the faction on each one.</p>

          <h4 id="creating-missions">Creating Missions</h4>

          <p>To create a new mission, randomly draw a or choose a faction card from the faction deck. If you are a member of this faction, roll for a random mission from the table in its description.</p>

          <p>Otherwise, this is the enemy faction involved in this mission. Roll on the Mission Types table below.</p>

          </table>

          <p>Missions can be of three different types, which determine how they affect the faction deck:</p>

          <p><em><strong>Offensive.</strong></em> A direct attack on an enemy faction.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Defensive.</strong></em> Defending against an enemy faction attack.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Support.</strong></em> Non-conflict missions that support or maintain the faction.</p>

          <div class="aside" id="mission-timers">
            <h4>Variant Rule: Mission Timers</h4>

            <p>Faction sandbox worlds can still seem passive, only changing in reaction to the player characters. If you want to make your worlds more dynamic you can use these variant rules for mission timers:</p>

            <p>Rather than generate a complete set of new missions after each session, missions persist for longer. Each mission has a number of timer checkboxes. Each session a mission is not taken by the party, a mission checkbox is marked off. Once all the checkboxes are marked off the mission defaults as though it failed, and the mission penalties come into effect.</p>
          </div>

          <h4 id="turning-missions-into-adventures">Turning Missions into Adventures</h4>

          <p>Once the players have chosen the mission for next weeks session, the DM needs to turn it into an adventure. The adventure, encounter, nonplayer character and environment creation guidelines and tables from chapters 3, 4 and 5 of the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em> are invaluable for this.</p>

          <p>You can use the strongholds and followers from the faction description in your adventure locations and encounters. You are, of course, also allowed to include whatever monsters, NPCs and locations you like.</p>

          <p>Missions should be shorter than normal adventures, typically taking about a day of game time (not including travel) and concluding in one or two sessions. You should plan the encounters accordingly.</p>

          <p>Most missions should also include one or two twists, possibly involving other factions. Factions might spy on, compete for mission objectives, or help the characters. Mission twists are also a good way to introduce new factions, where the player character's actions may decide whether they become friend or foe.</p>

          <p>You can randomly draw from the faction deck to see if other factions are involved. This way players may even find themselves pitted against members of their own faction.</p>

          <h4 id="between-missions">Between Missions</h4>

          <p>In addition to the normal downtime activities between adventures you should adjust the faction deck according to the outcome of the last mission. This reflects the change in the balance of power resulting from the character's actions. Factions lose or gain cards from the faction deck according to the type of mission and whether it was successful or not:</p>

        <h2>The Nightmare Under Dismas</h2>

        <div class="columns">

          <p>This introductory mini-adventure introduces the setting and allows the characters to get to know each other. Read the following to the party:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>The Black Griffin Company limps towards it's newest commission: reinforcing the royalist frontline against the Commonwealth Forces.</p>

            <p>In the wake of its last defeat, dessertion is rife. You've been sent ahead to the ancient city of Dismas to capture and return your erstwhile colleague, Crawface. For this you will receive a bounty of 140 gold pieces. You only get half if he's dead.</p>

            <p>You believe you've tracked him to a seedy poorhouse in the slum, Cemetery Hill. You watch the derelict building from the shadows of a nearby alley, under cover of night. Tramps and beggars come and go, or linger outside warming themselves by street fires.</p>

            <p>What will you do?</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <!-- Lead into the action faster: confusing beginning with no obvious things to do. -->

          <p>The party should find the poorhouse with little trouble.</p>

          <h3 id="the-poorhouse">1. The Poorhouse</h3>

          <p>If the players approach the poorhouse read the following:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>You can smell the rickety, poorhouse before you approach it. The thick stench of sweat, rotten food and despair is overwhelming. All but a handful of the wretches lingering scatter as you approach. The remaining members glare balefully at you.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>The poorhouse is actually a front for a smuggling operation in-and-out of the city. However, the beggars won't just tell strangers about it.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Old Sam (Choleric, Venal).</strong></em> Old Sam is the beggar "king". If the players start asking questions he will be pointed out to them. If they make any noise (say by arguing with Three) he comes out to investigate. He will help the players in exchange for money. He has a heavy cough caused by the black mold in his "throne room" (Intelligence (Medicine) check vs DC15 to diagnose). If they players can convince him he will reveal the hidden shaft (see below).</p>

          <p><em><strong>Secret: Miraculous Cure.</strong></em> Characters who spend any time watching the beggars coming and going notice on a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check vs DC 13 notice a hunchback beggar entering the poorhouse and, then leaving moments later cured of his deformity!</p>

          <p><em><strong>Secret: The List.</strong></em>Characters making passive Wisdom (Perception) check vs DC 15 notice the building listing a little towards the rear of the house. </p>

          <p><em><strong>Secret: The Hidden Shaft.</strong></em> In Old Sam's "throne room" there is an innocuous looking fireplace. On closer inspection the chimney stack has fallen through leaving a shaft leading to a hidden basement which is being used by smugglers. Anyone searching the room to will find it on a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check vs DC 15.</p>

        <div class="columns">
          <h3 id="smugglers-hideout">2. The Smuggler's Hideout</h3>

          <p>If the players climb down the chimney stack they arrive at the smuggler's hideout. Its pitch black but if the characters have a light source read the following:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>This small, damp room is stacked with boxes. Some of the crates are smashed, and bottles of spirits and other contraband spill out. A man lies dead in a pool of blood in the middle of the room</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p><em><strong>The Corpse</strong></em> The man is not Crawface, but a smuggler killed by a series of knife wounds to the stomach. Searching his body uncovers a folded piece of paper wrapping 9 gp. The piece of paper is a map of the smuggling route through the sewers and offers advantage on sewer crawl checks to escape the sewers.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Box of Rats.</strong></em> A passive Wisdom (Perception) check vs DC 10 indicates scratching noises from one box. If the characters open it two rats spill out and attempt to run to the hidden tunnel behind the boxes.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Secret: Hidden Booty.</strong></em> A successful Intelligence (Investigation) check vs DC 20 uncovers a hidden of 9 bottles of fine brandy worth 10 gp each, hidden in a crate.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Secret: Hidden Tunnel.</strong></em> Intelligence (Investigation) vs DC 15 to spot a trail of blood leading here:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>A rough tunnel is hidden behind a stack of crates, formed by pulling down the ancient bricks of the basement wall. The trail of blood leads into its shadowy recesses. The sound of trickling water comes from beyond.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <h3 id="dismas-sewers">2. Dismas' Sewers</h3>

          <p>Read the following to the players:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>You appear to be in the fabled city sewers. What strikes you, though, is the complete lack of smell. Sewers smell, you suppose, but these tunnels just smell of damp and age.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p><em><strong>Searching the sewers.</strong></em> The party can choose to search the sewers, attempting to follow the trail of blood. Use the sewer crawling skill challenge below.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Secret: Unused Sewers</strong></em> A successful passive Intelligence (History) check vs DC 13 will let a character know that the sewers are a relic of the Old Empire and haven't been used since that ancient age. The citizens of Dismas prefer to use the streets sa their latrines these days.</p>

          <div class="aside">

            </header>

            <p>This section of the sewers is covered in refuse, concealing an open hole covered by weakened boards and a sackcloth blanket. The boards will give way if players step on them.</p>

            <p>A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns the shape of the blanket where it has been disturbed by vermus coming and going from the nest. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of the floor is actually the cover of a hole.</p>

            <p>When a creature steps on the boards, they break, causing the the intruder to spill into the 20 foot pit below, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage and landing in area 4B.</p>

          <h4 id="bottom-of-pit">4B. Bottom of the Pit</h4>

          <p>Climbing back up their sheer surface of the hole back to the sewers requires a DC 20 Strength (Athletics). A failed check means the character gets halfway up the wall before losing their grip and falling 10 feet (1d6 bludgeoning damage). Climbing down is easier, only required a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.</p>
          
          <p>At the bottom of the pit is pool about 1 foot deep filled with brackish, stagnant water, Various tunnels line the bottom of the pit. From within can be heard the distant sounds of scratches and rat-like chittering.</p>

            <p><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> Casting <em>sleep</em> or <em>charm person</em> grants an automatic success as you enchant your way past vermus sentries.</p>

          <p>Witches, magi, spirits: most sane folk consider them superstitious legends. Fortunately, the templars are crazy enough to still believe these creatures exist, gone into hiding in secret conspiracies. It is the templars ancient mission to hunt down and eradicate all magic in the world, lest it cause the Witch Kings <!-- or devil? --> to return again.</p>

          <p>An age of new ideas needs a new magic. This offshoot of the Revelatorium no longer believes in return to the Old Empire.</p>

          <p>The layout and style of this monograph was based on the <strong>Dungeon Masters Guild</strong> <em>Adventure Template</em>. The main font is <em>Alegreya</em> by Juan Pablo del Peral which is more elegant and legible than the template default. It is also hosted on Google Webfonts and supports "true" italics and bold. The title font was <em>Andada SC</em>.</p>

          <p>This document was published using HTML, JavaScript and CSS, and composed using open source, web technologies including Node.js, Grunt, NPM, Bower, SASS, Polymer and Yarn. The PDF was generated using Chrome's PDF print preview feature. The monster stat blocks were generated using a web component of my own creation, based on Val Markovic's open source <em>Statblock5e</em>.</p>
