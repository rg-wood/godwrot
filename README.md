_**[Source](https://github.com/rg-wood/godwrot)** | **[Roadmap](https://github.com/rg-wood/godwrot/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Aenhancement)** | **[Issues](https://github.com/rg-wood/godwrot/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Abug)**_

**GODWROT** is a _Powered by the Apocalypse_ hack of grubby fantasy inspired by _Warhammer_, _Terry Pratchett_ and the British old-school.

## Protagonists

In **GODWROT** you play as **protagonists**, individuals of dubious morality who are in over their heads. To create a protagonist in **GODWROT** follow these steps:

1. Assign [stats](#stats).
2. Choose a [flaw](#flaws).
3. Pick 3 [player moves](#player-moves).

### Stats

Assign the following numbers to each of your **stats**: +2, +1, +1, 0, -1. The stats for **GODWROT** are:

- **Agility:** reflexive or graceful.
- **Cunning**: inquisitive or exploratory.
- **Strength:** aggressive or forceful.
- **Wits**: calculating or methodical.
- **Will:** persuasive or assertive.

### Flaws

All protagonists in **GODWROT** are broken in some way. **Flaws** represent this and determine when you can use the [Snatch Defeat](#snatch-defeat) basic move. Choose a flaw from the list below and record it on your protagonist sheet:

- Bolshy
- Bumbling
- Cowardly
- Devious
- Drunk
- Fanatical
- Greedy
- Gruff
- Reckless
- Treacherous
- Wicked

### Player Moves

## Rules

The game is a **conversation**.

### Basic Moves

#### Snatch Defeat

When you **succeed with a move related to your flaw** you can choose to fail that roll instead and take 1 [luck point](#luck). Describe how your [flaw](#flaws) intervenes to frustrate your goals and causes you to fail. Make it [grubby](#grubby).

You may spend a luck point to accidentally succeed any failed roll related to your flaw. Similarly, describe how luck allows you to succeed despite your failings.

For example:

> Gregori succeeds on an attack move on a roll of 11. This move is related to his flaw, Reckless. He decides to Snatch Defeat and fail the attack move instead.
>
> Gregori's player describes him becoming off balance and the mod determines he takes a -1 penalty to his next Agility roll.
>
> Later, Gregori is fighting Marcus, the Bandit King. It's an important fight but he fails an attack move at a crucial moment. Deciding to spend luck, he somehow succeeds instead. His player describes his stroke of luck, saying "as I blindly attack, my broadsword swings wild, missing Marcus' head and instead slamming into a line of rope tying up a crate." The mod determines the crate slams into Marcus' head, blood and brains splattering everywhere.

You do not [Mark Experience](#mark-experience) when you use this move to fail a roll.

### Harm

### Bonus to Carry Forward

### Resource Points

#### Luck

**Luck** are resource points that represent Lady Luck's favour, and are key to the see-saw mechanic of self-sabotage and unlikely luck that is core to the fiction of **GODWROT**. See the description of the [Snatch Defeat](#snatch-defeat) move for more information on how luck work.

## Moderation

The moderator (or **mod**) is responsible for running the game.

### Agendas

**Agendas** are the reason you play **GODWROT**. They include:

- Make it grubby.
- Keep the protagonists off balance.
- Play to find out.

#### Grubby

**GODWROT** is about grubby fantasy, a sub-genre of low fantasy that is unique to the British old-school. To be grubby is to be farcical, bawdy, pessimistic, grotesque, bolshy and satirical. Revel in these themes, shamelessly.

### Principles

The **principles** are things you should seek to do whenever you speak, in the game.

When you **prepare the game**:

- Create interesting dilemmas, not interesting plots.
- Create open-ended encounters, not scenes.

When you **portray the world**:

- Sprinkle grubby and convoluted details everywhere.
- Make the world seem real through (pseudo-)historicism.
- Name everyone, make everyone human.

When you **run the game**:

- Think offscreen, too.
- Respond with challenging circumstances and occasional rewards.
- Make the lives of the protagonists miserable.
- But also be a fan of the protagonists.
- Draw the protagonists into mystery.
- Taint everything with corruption.

When you **speak**:

- Address the protagonists, not the players.
- Make your [reaction](#reaction), but never speak its name.
- Ask provocative questions and build on the answers.
- Sometimes, reflect a question back upon the players.

### Reactions

The reactions are:

- Separate them.
- Put them together.
- Introduce a high-stakes situation.
- Deal harm.
- Trade harm for harm.
- Announce offscreen badness.
- Announce future badness.
- Take away one of their things.
- Demonstrate one of their things' bad sides.
- Give them a difficult decision to make.
- Tell them the possible consequences and ask.
- Turn their move back on them.
- Reveal a mystery that obscures.
- Introduce corruption to obstruct.
