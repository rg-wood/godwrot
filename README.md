### Reactions

:::

Reactions are the specific things you say in any moment. There are two
different cases where you use the Reactions, and you use them
differently in each of those cases. When the players look at you
expectantly, you make a regular Reaction. When a player fails a die roll
(getting 6 or lower), you make a hard Reaction.

Regular reactions should\...

1.  \...follow logically from the fiction.
2.  \...give the player an opportunity to react.
3.  \...set you up for a future harder move.

The Reactions are:

#### Separate them

#### Put them together

#### Introduce a high-stakes situation

#### Trade harm for harm

#### Deal harm

#### Announce off-screen badness

#### Announce future badness

#### Take away one of their Things

#### Demonstrate one of their Things' bad sides

#### Give them a difficult decision to make

#### Tell them the possible consequences and ask

#### Turn their move back on them

#### Make a move from one of your Threats or Fronts
