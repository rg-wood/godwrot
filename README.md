**GODWROT** is a _Powered by the Apocalypse_ hack of grubby fantasy inspired by _Warhammer_, _Terry Pratchett_ and the British old-school.

## Protagonists

In **GODWROT** you play as **protagonists**, individuals of dubious morality who are in over their heads. To create a protagonist in **GODWROT** follow these steps:

1. Assign [stats](#stats).
2. Set [harm](#harm) at 4 + Strength + Will.
3. Choose a [flaw](#flaws).
4. Pick 3 [moves](#protagonist-moves).

### Stats

Assign the following numbers to each of your **stats**: +2, +1, +1, 0, -1. The stats for **GODWROT** are:

- **Agility:** reflexive or graceful.
- **Cunning**: inquisitive or exploratory.
- **Strength:** aggressive or forceful.
- **Wits**: calculating or methodical.
- **Will:** persuasive or assertive.

### Flaws

All protagonists in **GODWROT** are broken in some way. **Flaws** represent this and determine when you can use the [Snatch Defeat](#snatch-defeat) basic move. Choose a flaw from the list below and record it on your protagonist sheet:

- Bolshy
- Bumbling
- Cowardly
- Devious
- Drunk
- Fanatical
- Greedy
- Gruff
- Reckless
- Treacherous
- Wicked

### Protagonist Moves

**Protagonist moves** are custom moves that set your protagonist apart from the others. When you make your protagonist, pick three options from the below. Fill in the blanks and give the new move a name:

- When you do something related to [speciality] roll for a [bonus](#bonuses).
- When you do something related to [speciality] gain hold. Spend hold for a [bonus](#bonuses).
- You have the ability to [active power]. It counts as base move using [stat]
- You have [passive power with constant effect].
- You have a [thing]. When applicable it adds two [bonuses](#bonuses).

## Rules

The game is a **conversation**. Somebody says something, someone else replies, and maybe someone else chimes in. Players talk about the fiction—the world of the characters and the things that happen around them. As they play, the rules will chime in, too. Players take turns in the natural flow of the conversation, which always has some back-and-forth. The mod says something, the players respond. The players ask questions or make statements, the mod tells them what happens next.

#### Moves

Every so often, when a player describes their protagonist doing, it triggers a **move**. Moves are rules that tell you when they trigger and what effect they have. A move depends on a fictional action and always has some fictional effect. Follow the moves' description to see what you need to do and what happens.

#### Rolling

Some moves will tell you to make a **roll**. Roll 2d6 and add any modifiers and/or stats that apply. A roll fails on a 6-. Failure means the mod makes a [hard move](#mod-moves).

#### Bonuses

Some [moves](#moves)...

…Say “take +1 forward.” That means to take +1 to your next move roll (not damage). The bonus can be greater than +1, or even a penalty, like -1. There also might be a condition, such as “take +1 forward to hack and slash,” in which case the bonus applies only to the next time you roll hack and slash, not any other move.

…Say “take +1 ongoing.” That means to take +1 to all move rolls (not damage). The bonus can be larger than +1, or it can be a penalty, like -1. There also might be a condition, such as “take +1 ongoing to volley.” An ongoing bonus also says what causes it to end, like “until you dismiss the spell” or “until you atone to your deity.”

…Give you “hold.” Hold is currency that allows you to make some choices later on by spending the hold as the move describes. Hold is always saved up for the move that generated it; you can’t spend your hold from defend on trap expert or vice versa, for example.

#### Harm

**Harm** is a measure of how much physical and mental stress a character has taken. When you're asked to deal harm, reduce the character's harm by -1 or -2, depending on the severity of the fictional damage. An average NPC has 2 harm, while stronger characters can have 3 to 4 harm.

### Basic Moves

#### Defy Danger

When you **act despite an imminent threat** or **suffer a calamity**, say how you deal with it and roll. The mod lets you know which of your [stats](#stats) you roll with. **On a 10+**, you do what you set out to do, or the threat doesn’t come to bear. The mod may offer a +1 forward, +1 ongoing or hold. **On a 7–9**, you stumble, hesitate, or flinch: the mod will offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain or ugly choice.

#### Snatch Defeat

When you **succeed with a roll related to your flaw** you can choose to fail that roll instead and hold 1. Describe how your [flaw](#flaws) intervenes to frustrate your goals and causes you to fail. Make it [grubby](#grubby).

You may spend your hold to accidentally succeed any failed roll related to your flaw. Similarly, describe how luck allows you to succeed despite your failings.

For example:

> Gregori succeeds on an attack move with a roll of 11. This move is related to his flaw, Reckless. He decides to Snatch Defeat and fail the attack move instead, taking 1 hold.
>
> Gregori's player describes him becoming off balance and the mod determines he takes a -1 penalty to his next Agility roll.
>
> Later, Gregori is fighting Marcus, the Bandit King. It's an important fight but he fails an attack move at a crucial moment. Deciding to spend his hold, he somehow succeeds instead. His player describes his stroke of luck, saying "as I blindly attack, my broadsword swings wild, missing Marcus' head and instead slamming into a line of rope tying up a crate." The mod determines the crate slams into Marcus' head, blood and brains splattering everywhere.

## Moderation

The moderator (or **mod**) is responsible for running the game.

### Agendas

**Agendas** are the reason you play **GODWROT**. They include:

- Make it grubby.
- Keep the protagonists off balance.
- Play to find out.

#### Grubby

**GODWROT** is about grubby fantasy, a sub-genre of low fantasy that is unique to the British old-school. To be grubby is to be farcical, bawdy, pessimistic, grotesque, bolshy and satirical. Revel in these themes, shamelessly.

### Principles

The **principles** are things you should seek to do whenever you speak, in the game.

When you **prepare the game**:

- Create interesting dilemmas, not interesting plots.
- Create open-ended encounters, not scenes.

When you **portray the world**:

- Sprinkle grubby and convoluted details everywhere.
- Make the world seem real through (pseudo-)historicism.
- Name everyone, make everyone human.

When you **run the game**:

- Think offscreen, too.
- Respond with challenging circumstances and occasional rewards.
- Make the lives of the protagonists miserable.
- But also be a fan of the protagonists.
- Draw the protagonists into mystery.
- Taint everything with corruption.

When you **speak**:

- Address the protagonists, not the players.
- Make your [move](#mod-moves), but never speak its name.
- Ask provocative questions and build on the answers.
- Sometimes, reflect a question back upon the players.

### Mod Moves

Mods can make their own moves:

- When everyone looks to you to find out what happens make a soft move.
- When the players give you a golden opportunity make a soft move.
- When they roll a 6- make a had move.

A **soft move** is one without immediate, irrevocable consequences. That usually means it’s something not all that bad, like revealing that there’s more treasure if they can just find a way past the golem (offer an opportunity with cost). It can also mean that it’s something bad, but they have time to avoid it, like having the goblin archers loose their arrows (announce future badness) with a chance for them to dodge out of danger.

**Hard move**, on the other hand, have immediate consequences. Dealing damage is almost always a hard move, since it means a loss of HP that won’t be recovered without some action from the players.

Generally when the players are just looking at you to find out what happens you make a soft move. Otherwise you make a hard move.

The mod moves are:

- Separate them.
- Put them together.
- Introduce a high-stakes situation.
- Deal harm.
- Trade harm for harm.
- Announce offscreen badness.
- Announce future badness.
- Take away one of their things.
- Demonstrate one of their things' bad sides.
- Give them a difficult decision to make.
- Tell them the possible consequences and ask.
- Turn their move back on them.
- Reveal a mystery that obscures.
- Introduce corruption to obstruct.
