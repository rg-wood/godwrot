**GODWROT** is a _Powered by the Apocalypse_ hack of grubby fantasy inspired by _Warhammer_, _Terry Pratchett_ and the British old-school.

## Protagonists

In **GODWROT** you play as **protagonists**, individuals of dubious morality who are in over their heads. To create a protagonist in **GODWROT** follow these steps:

1. Assign [attributes](#attributes).
2. Assign [trust](#trust) scores.
3. Choose a [flaw](#flaws).
4. Pick 3 [player moves](#player-moves).

### Attributes

Assign the following numbers to your **attributes**: +2, +1, +1, 0, -1. The 5 core attributes for **GODWROT** are:

- **Agility:** reflexive or graceful.
- **Cunning**: inquisitive or exploratory.
- **Strength:** aggressive or forceful.
- **Wits**: calculating or methodical.
- **Will:** persuasive or assertive.

### Trust

Every protagonist in the game has a **trust** stat with every other character. Assign the following trust scores that their protagonist has toward the other protagonists: +2 for the one they know best, -1 for the one they know least, and +1 for all others. Trust with all NPCs starts at 0.

### Player Moves

The next stage of creating protagonists is to pick 3 **player moves**. When a player picks a move, they pick an option from the list below, give the move a title, and fill in the blanks. Each move gets recorded on their protagonist sheet.

• When you do something relating to [speciality], add +1.

• You have the ability to [do some sort of active special power]. It counts as a basic move using [stat].

• You have [some passive special power that has a constant effect].

• You have a [thing]. When applicable, it adds +1 to [attribute] and [attribute].

• When you do [speciality], mark XP.

• Add +1 to [attribute].

### Flaws

All protagonists in **GODWROT** are broken in some way. **Flaws** represent this and determine when you can use the [Snatch Defeat](#snatch-defeat) basic move. Choose a flaw from the list below and record it on your protagonist sheet:

- Bolshy
- Bumbling
- Cowardly
- Devious
- Drunk
- Fanatical
- Greedy
- Gruff
- Reckless
- Treacherous
- Wicked

## Rules

The game is like a **conversation**. People describe what their protagonists do, ask questions about what’s going on, and talk in character.

At some point, the mod will determine that something requires a roll. Actions require a roll when they are opposed by other characters or run the risk of interesting failure. When one of these conditions is met, the player needs to roll for a [basic move](#basic-moves). The mod will name which [attribute](#attributes) applies to the situation. The player rolls two six-sided dice and adds their attribute to the sum. The effects depend on the basic move in question.

Moves and [reactions](#reactions) should continually propel the game forward in interesting ways. When a player succeeds on a move, their success should be interesting and introduce new opportunities for them. When a player gets a 7-9 on a [basic move](#basic-moves), the dilemma and hard bargain should create compelling drama, and either choice should be interesting and take the story in new directions. When a player fails on a basic move, the mod should respond with a hard reaction that fundamentally changes the situation and demands new kinds of action.

Whenever people look at the mod expectantly, the mod should make a regular reaction. This should create new things for the players to react to. The mod should then go on to say, “So, what do you do?”

### Basic Moves

#### Taking Action

When you **take an action that risks failure or opposition**, roll with one of the basic [attributes](#attributes).

- On a 10+, you succeed at your goal. As appropriate, the mod might award you: [resource points](#resource-points), [harm](#harm) dealt, or a [bonus to carry forward](#bonus-to-carry-forward).
- On a 7-9, the mod will offer you a hard bargain or a cost. If you agree to that hard bargain or cost, you succeed at your goal (and as appropriate, the mod might award you resource points, harm dealt, or a bonus to carry forward).

#### Helping or Hindering

When you **help or hinder another protagonist**, roll your trust stat with that person.

- On a 10+, add or subtract 2 from their roll.
- On a 7-9, the mod will name a cost; if you accept the cost, add or subtract 2 from their roll.

When you **help or hinder a NPC**, roll your trust stat with that person.

- On a 10+, they either succeed or fail - your choice.
- On a 7-9, the mod will name a cost; if you accept the cost, they either succeed or fail - your choice.

#### Snatch Defeat

When you **succeed with a move related to your Flaw** you can choose to fail that roll instead and take 1 [luck point](#luck). Describe how your [flaw](#flaws) intervenes to frustrate your goals and causes you to fail. Make it [grubby](#grubby).

You may spend a luck point to accidentally succeed any failed roll related to your flaw. Similarly, describe how luck allows you to succeed despite your failings.

For example:

> Gregori succeeds on an attack move on a roll of 11. This move is related to his flaw, Reckless. He decides to Snatch Defeat and fail the attack move instead.
>
> Gregori's player describes him becoming off balance and the mod determines he takes a -1 penalty to his next Agility roll.
>
> Later, Gregori is fighting Marcus, the Bandit King. It's an important fight but he fails an attack move at a crucial moment. Deciding to spend luck, he somehow succeeds instead. His player describes his stroke of luck, saying "as I blindly attack, my broadsword swings wild, missing Marcus' head and instead slamming into a line of rope tying up a crate." The mod determines the crate slams into Marcus' head, blood and brains splattering everywhere.

You do not [Mark Experience](#mark-experience) when you use this move to fail a roll.

#### Mark Experience

Whenever you **fail a roll** you earn an experience point. Mark it on the Experience section of your sheet. When you hit 5 experience points, erase all of it and take a new [player move](#player-moves). If you’ve already got at least one move that references each of your specialities, you may create a new speciality and reference it in the player move you purchase.

#### Betray Trust

When you **betray another character** you gain a +2 bonus to a roll, but their trust score goes down by 1.

#### Sacrifice

When you **make meaningful sacrifices for another character** your trust score toward that person will go up by 1.

### Harm

Every protagonist has a harm clock with six sections. When characters take **harm** in the game, they mark a number of sections equal to whatever amount of harm the mod tells them they take. Point out the harm clock, and explain that when it’s filled all the way up, the characters are [taken out](#taken-out) of the action.

#### Dealing Harm

When someone succeeds on a [Taking Action](#taking-action) roll, it’ll sometimes make sense that they would deal harm to their opposition. [Harm](#harm) is typically physical or mental harm that’s brought about by violence or stress. When someone does harm to someone else, the mod will rate that harm from 1-3. protagonist harm gets marked down on the harm clock on their protagonist sheet.

NPC harm gets noted by the mod. NPCs can typically take 2 harm before they’re [taken out](#taken-out), but tougher NPCs might have more.

#### Taken Out

When a character has all of their harm sections filled in, they’re dead and **taken out** of the action. If the character was a protagonist, the player should create a new protagonist.

### Bonus to Carry Forward

Sometimes, succeeding on a [Taking Action](#taking-action) roll means that the protagonist is set up for future successes. In these cases, the mod can award a **+1 bonus** that the protagonist can apply to their next roll. The player should mark that bonus on their protagonist sheet.

### Resource Points

When someone succeeds (with a 10+ or a 7-9) on a [Taking Action](#taking-action) roll, it’ll sometimes make sense to represent their success with a number of **resource points**. For example, if someone tries to read a person’s facial expressions and determine their true intent in a conversation, they might make a roll. If they get a 10+, the mod might determine that they have 3 conversation points, and they can spend those points 1-for-1 to get answers about the character’s motivations and goals during the conversation. Resource points are always given a name and function at the time they are awarded. In most cases, resource points should be temporary, lasting until the end of a scene or situation.

#### Luck

**Luck** are resource points that represent Lady Luck's favour, and are key to the see-saw mechanic of self-sabotage and unlikely luck that is core to the fiction of **GODWROT**. See the description of the [Snatch Defeat](#snatch-defeat) move for more information on how luck work.

## Moderation

The moderator (or **mod**) is responsible for running and moderating the game. In particular, the mod will have to make judgment calls about what requires a [Taking Action](#taking-action) roll, and what is outright impossible. The mod should use their veto right judiciously and sparingly. If someone wants to take an action that subverts the genre, that’s good! It’s only when they want to take an action that is impossible or nonsensical for a given genre that the mod should say that something isn’t possible. When the mod says this, they should use the line, “I don’t think that’s possible, but you could instead [make some other interesting choice], if you’d like.”

Early in the first session, the mod should juggle two responsibilities:

• Follow the protagonists around, and learn what they’re all about.

• Give the players a sense of what the world is like, and how it operates.

Astute players will realize that these two things can sometimes be at odds with one another. The way you navigate this combination of responsibilities is by honouring your [agendas](#agendas) and your [principles](#principles).

### Agendas

**Agendas** are the reason you play **GODWROT**. They include:

- Make it grubby.
- Keep the protagonists off balance.
- Play to find out.

#### Grubby

**GODWROT** is about grubby fantasy, a sub-genre of low fantasy that is unique to the British old-school. To be grubby is to be farcical, bawdy, pessimistic, grotesque, bolshy and satirical. Revel in these themes, shamelessly.

### Principles

The **principles** are things you should seek to do whenever you speak, in the game.

When you **prepare the game**:

- Create interesting dilemmas, not interesting plots.
- Create open-ended encounters, not scenes.

When you **portray the world**:

- Sprinkle grubby and convoluted details everywhere.
- Make the world seem real through (pseudo-)historicism.
- Name everyone, make everyone human.

When you **run the game**:

- Think offscreen, too.
- Respond with challenging circumstances and occasional rewards.
- Make the lives of the protagonists miserable.
- But also be a fan of the protagonists.
- Draw the protagonists into mystery.
- Taint everything with corruption.

When you **speak**:

- Address the protagonists, not the players.
- Make your [reaction](#reaction), but never speak its name.
- Ask provocative questions and build on the answers.
- Sometimes, reflect a question back upon the players.

### Reactions

**Reactions** are the specific things you say in any moment. There are two
different cases where you use the reactions, and you use them
differently in each of those cases. When the players look at you
expectantly, you make a regular reaction. When a player fails a die roll
(getting 6 or lower), you make a hard reaction.

**Regular reactions** should\...

1.  \...follow logically from the fiction.
2.  \...give the player an opportunity to react.
3.  \...set you up for a future hard reaction.

**Hard reactions** should\...

1. ...it follows logically from the fiction.
2. ...and it’s irrevocable.

The reactions are:

- Separate them.
- Put them together.
- Introduce a high-stakes situation.
- Deal harm.
- Trade harm for harm.
- Announce offscreen badness.
- Announce future badness.
- Take away one of their things.
- Demonstrate one of their things' bad sides.
- Give them a difficult decision to make.
- Tell them the possible consequences and ask.
- Turn their move back on them.
- Make them investigate.
- Introduce corruption to obstruct.

## Design Notes

The concept of **GODWROT** has been bubbling around in my head for a while now. It started with an observation: that many _Powered by the Apocalypse_ fantasy games tend towards the high fantasy, and that players might want a low fantasy flavour. From that, _Bleak World_ was born, a partially completed document that went through a number of versions and iterations, all of which sat on my hard drive, unloved for many years. That is, until I came across [Simple World](https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/simple-world).

Creating a PbtA game can be overwhelming, but _Simple World_ gave me a bare-bones framework to iterate off. Vincent Baker [exhorts](https://lumpley.games/2019/12/30/powered-by-the-apocalypse-part-1/) us to "make something you can try" and iterate on that, but where to begin? _Simple World_ was that beginning.

A name change was required (_Bleak World_ was too dull). I chose "GODWROT" as a riff on [Wargod!](https://grislyeye.com/products/wargod/), my _Troika!_ hack, because this game is a spiritual successor to that one. Using the skeleton cut from _Simple World_, I began a process of continual playtest. The result is the document you're reading now.

### Grubby Fantasy

> Since the game itself relies so much on atmosphere (the term “grubby fantasy” has been coined, to contrast with “shiny fantasy” which previously dominated role-playing), the world is highly necessary in order to convey that atmosphere.
>
> – _Open Box X-tra’, White Dwarf 87_ by the WFRP Design Team, 1987

Though fallen out of use, grubby fantasy was the term coined by the designers of early _Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay_ to describe their particular flavour of fantasy. It's a distinctly British genre that stands in opposition to the glossy high fantasy of many modern fantasy games, and it's the term I use to describe my games because, well, no other words quite fits. Low fantasy is one thing but doesn't seem narrow enough. Grimdark takes itself too seriously. Dark fantasy is too dark. So, grubby it is.

### The British Old-School

My love of grubby fantasy comes out of that fetid period of creativity in the 80s that spawned _Warhammer_, _Fighting Fantasy_ and _The Colour of Magic_.

Yet, the inspiration for **GODWROT** more properly begins with _The Hobbit_. The Middle Earth of this early work is less shiny than the one depicted in _The Lord of the Rings_. _The Hobbit_ is less an epic adventure than it is a fairy tale gone wrong. Our protagonists aren't motivated by heroism, but by greed, wrath, guilt and general confusion.

### Stealing Defeat

Too often, the systems I use to run my grubby fantasy games produce PCs that are too competent. As experience accrues, protagonists become increasingly capable, which breaks the setting. Characters in grubby fantasy are defined by their powerlessness. This game isn't about heroes, it's about wretches, twerps and other dubious figures that are, if not villains, corrupt at best.

At the heart of **GODWROT** is the [Steal Defeat](#steal-defeat) move (as in "stealing defeat from the jaws of victory"), which emulates the picaresque aspects of the fiction. This move can affect all aspects of play, turning heroes into fools that prosper despite themselves.
