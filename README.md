# Wyrgüd

**Wyrgüd** is a _Powered by the Apocalypse_ grimhack of grubby fantasy inspired by _Warhammer_, _Terry Pratchett_ and the British old-school.

## Characters

### Attributes

Assign the following numbers to your attributes: +2, +1, +1, 0, -1. The 5 core attributes for **Wyrgüd** are:

- **Agility:** reflexive or graceful.
- **Cunning**: inquisitive or exploratory.
- **Strength:** aggressive or forceful.
- **Wits**: calculating or methodical.
- **Will:** persuasive or assertive.

### Trust

Every PC in the game has a Trust stat with every other character. Assign the following Trust scores that their character has toward the other PCs: +2 for the one they know best, -1 for the one they know least, and +1 for all others. They will also list “NPCs: 0,” as the default is that they have a Trust stat with all NPCs that starts at 0.

Trust scores will go up and down over play. Characters can betray one another for a +2 bonus to a roll, but their Trust score goes down by 1. Characters can make meaningful sacrifices for someone, and their Trust score toward that person will go up by one.

### Harm

Every character has a harm clock, with six sections. When characters take harm in the game, they mark a number of sections equal to whatever amount of harm the Mod tells them they take. Point out the harm clock, and explain that when it’s filled all the way up, the characters are taken out of the action

### Player Moves

The next stage of creating characters is to pick 3 moves. When a player picks a move, they pick an option from the list below, give the move a title, and fill in the blanks. Each move gets recorded on their character sheet.

• When you do something relating to [speciality], add +1.

• You have the ability to [do some sort of active special power]. It counts as a basic move using [stat].

• You have [some passive special power that has a constant effect].

• You have a [thing]. When applicable, it adds +1 to [attribute] and [attribute].

• When you do [speciality], mark XP.

• Add +1 to [attribute].

### Flaws

All characters in **Wyrgüd** are broken in some way. Flaws represent this and determine when you can use the [Snatch Defeat](#snatch-defeat) basic move. Choose a Flaw from the list below:

- Reckless
- Slow-witted
- Fanatical
- Gruff
- Devious
- Foolish
- Faithless
- Drunk
- Bumbling
- Wicked
- Treacherous
- Cowardly
- Unlucky

### Basic Moves

#### Taking Action

When you take an action that risks failure or opposition, roll with one of the basic attributes. On a 10+, you succeed at your goal. As appropriate, the Mod might award you: resource points, harm dealt, or a bonus to carry forward. On a 7-9, the Mod will offer you a hard bargain or a cost. If you agree to that hard bargain or cost, you succeed at your goal (and as appropriate, the Mod might award you resource points, harm dealt, or a bonus to carry forward).

#### Helping or Hindering

When you **help or hinder another PC**, roll your Trust stat with that person. On a 10+, add or subtract 2 from their roll. On a 7-9, the Mod will name a cost; if you accept the cost, add or subtract 2 from their roll.

When you **help or hinder a NPC**, roll your Trust stat with that person. On a 10+, they either succeed or fail - your choice. On a 7-9, the Mod will name a cost; if you accept the cost, they either succeed or fail - your choice.

#### Mark Experience

Whenever you roll a highlighted attribute you earn a point of Experience. Mark it on the Experience section of your sheet. When you hit 5 Experience, erase all of it and take a new [Player Move](#player-moves). If you’ve already got at least one move that references each of your specialities, you may create a new speciality and reference it in the Player Move you purchase.

#### Snatch Defeat

When you **succeed with a move related to your Flaw** you can choose to fail that roll instead and hold 1. Describe how your Flaw intervenes to frustrate your goals and causes you to fail. Make it [grubby](#be-grubby)

You may spend the hold to accidentally succeed any failed roll related to your Flaw. Again, describe how luck allows you succeed in spite of yourself.

You do not [Mark Experience](#mark-experience) when you use this move to fail a roll, or when you use hold on a failed roll.

For example:

> Gregori succeeds on an attack move on a roll of 11. This move is related to his flaw, Reckless. He decides to Snatch Defeat and fail the attack move instead.
>
> Gregori takes becomes off-balance and takes a -1 penalty to the next Agility roll he makes and holds 1.
>
> Later, Gregori is fighting Marcus, the Bandit King. It's an important fight, but at a crucial moment, he fails an attack move. Deciding to spend his hold, he instead succeeds accidentally. His player says, “as I blindly attack, my broadsword swings wild, missing Marcus' head and instead slamming into a line of rope tying a crate up. It slams into Marcus' head, blood and brains splattering everywhere.”

## Moderation

The Mod is responsible for running and moderating the game. In particular, The Mod will have to make judgment calls about what requires a [Taking Action](#taking-action) roll, and what is outright impossible. The Mod should use their veto right judiciously and sparingly. If someone wants to take an action that subverts the genre, that’s good! It’s only when they want to take an action that is impossible or nonsensical for a given genre that the Mod should say that something isn’t possible. When the Mod says this, they should use the line, “I don’t think that’s possible, but you could instead [make some other interesting choice], if you’d like.”

Early in the first session, the Mod should juggle two responsibilities:

• Follow the PCs around, and learn what they’re all about.

• Give the players a sense of what the world is like, and how it operates.

Astute players will realize that these two things can sometimes be at odds with one another. Mod, the way you navigate this combination of responsibilities is by honouring your [Agendas](#agendas) and your [Principles](#principles).

### Agendas

Agendas are the reason you play **Wyrgüd**. They include:

#### Make it exciting

#### Play to find out

#### Be grubby

**Wyrgüd** is about grubby fantasy, a sub-genre of the low fantasy idiomatic to the British old-school fantasy scene. To be grubby is to be farcical, bawdy, pessimistic, grotesque and satirical. Revel in these themes, shamelessly.

### Principles

The Principles are things you should seek to do whenever you speak, in the game.

#### Sprinkle grubby and convoluted details everywhere

#### Make the world seem real

#### Build a bigger world through play

#### Create interesting dilemmas, not interesting plots

#### Address yourself to the characters, not the players

#### Make your move, but misdirect

#### Make your move, but never speak its name

#### Look at your NPCs and ideas through crosshairs

#### Name everyone, make everyone human

#### Ask provocative questions and build on the answers

#### Respond with challenging circumstances and occasional rewards

#### Make the lives of the player characters miserable

#### But also be a fan of the players' characters

#### Think offscreen, too

#### Sometimes, reflect a question back upon the players

#### Draw the characters into mystery

#### Reveal corruption

### Reactions

Reactions are the specific things you say in any moment. There are two
different cases where you use the Reactions, and you use them
differently in each of those cases. When the players look at you
expectantly, you make a regular Reaction. When a player fails a die roll
(getting 6 or lower), you make a hard Reaction.

Regular reactions should\...

1.  \...follow logically from the fiction.
2.  \...give the player an opportunity to react.
3.  \...set you up for a future harder move.

The Reactions are:

#### Separate them

#### Put them together

#### Introduce a high-stakes situation

#### Trade harm for harm

As [Deal Harm](#deal-harm), but a PC is dealt harm in return.

#### Deal harm

When someone succeeds on a [Taking Action](#taking-action) roll, it’ll sometimes make sense that they would deal harm to their opposition. [Harm](#harm) is typically physical harm that’s brought about by violence or stress. When someone does harm to someone else, the Mod will rate that harm from 1-3. PC harm gets marked down on the harm clock on their character sheet. NPC harm gets noted by the Mod. NPCs can typically take 2 harm before they’re [taken out of the action](#taken-out), but tougher NPCs might have more.

#### Announce offscreen badness

#### Announce future badness

#### Take away one of their Things

#### Demonstrate one of their Things' bad sides

#### Give them a difficult decision to make

#### Tell them the possible consequences and ask

#### Turn their move back on them

#### Make a move from one of your Threats or Fronts

### Talking and Moves

The game is like a conversation. People describe what their characters do, ask questions about what’s going on, and talk in character. If someone says something that seems untrue or unreasonable, the Mod is allowed to say, “I don’t think that’s possible, but you could instead [make some other interesting choice], if you’d like.”

At some point, the Mod will determine that something requires a roll. Actions require a roll when they are opposed by other characters or run the risk of interesting failure. When one of these conditions is met, the player needs to roll for a [basic move](#basic-moves). The Mod will name which [attribute](#attributes) applies to the situation. The player rolls two six-sided dice and adds their attribute to the sum. The effects depend on the basic move in question.

[Moves](#moves) and [reactions](#reactions) should continually propel the game forward in interesting ways. When a player succeeds on a move, their success should be interesting and introduce new opportunities for them. When a player gets a 7-9 on a [basic move](#basic-moves), the dilemma and hard bargain should create compelling drama, and either choice should be interesting and take the story in new directions. When a player fails on a basic move, the move should respond with a hard reaction that fundamentally changes the situation and demands new kinds of action.

Whenever people look at the Mod expectantly, the Mod should make a soft reaction. This should create new things for the players to react to. The Mod should then go on to say, “So, what do you do?”

### Taken Out

When a character has all of their harm sections filled in, they’re dead and taken out of the action. When a character is taken out of the action. If the character was a PC, the player should create a new character.

### Bonus to Carry Forward

Sometimes, succeeding on a [Taking Action](#taking-action) roll means that the PC is set up for future successes. In these cases, the Mod can award a +1 bonus that the PC can apply to their next roll. The player should mark that bonus on their character sheet.

## Design Notes

The concept of **Wyrgüd** has been bubbling around in my head for a while now. It started with an observation: that many _Powered by the Apocalypse_ fantasy games tend towards the high fantasy, and that there's a gap in the hobby for a low fantasy flavour. From that, _Bleak World_ was born, a partially completed document that went through a number of versions and iterations which sat on my hard drive, unloved for many years. That is, until I came across [Simple World](https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/simple-world).

Creating a PbtA game can be overwhelming, but _Simple World_ gave me a bare-bones framework to iterate off. Vincent Baker [exhorts](https://lumpley.games/2019/12/30/powered-by-the-apocalypse-part-1/) us to "make something you can try" and iterate on that, but where to begin? _Simple World_ was that beginning.

A name change was required (_Bleak World_ was too dull). I chose "Wyrgüd" as a riff on [Wargod!](https://grislyeye.com/products/wargod/), my _Troika!_ hack, because this game is a spiritual successor to that one. Using the skeleton cut from _Simple World_, I began a process of continual playtest. The result is the document you're reading now.

### Stealing Defeat

Too often, the systems I use to run my grubby fantasy games produce PCs that are too competent. As experience accrues, protagonists become increasingly capable, which breaks the setting. Characters in grubby fantasy are defined by their powerlessness. This game isn't about heroes, it's about wretches, twerps and other dubious figures that are, if not villains, corrupt at best.

At the heart of **Wyrgüd** is the [Steal Defeat](#steal-defeat) move, which emulates the picaresque aspects of the fiction. This move can affect all aspects of play, turning heroes into fools that prosper despite themselves.
