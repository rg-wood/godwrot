While most imagine Locksmith's Guild is a simple trade organisation, it in fact uses its monopoly on locks to control the city finances.

Bonded guild locksmiths wear a chain with a lock about their right shoulder. The chains and locks are made of different metals depending on your rank: copper for apprentices, iron for journeymen, etc.
