> You can see the lines of the once fantastically beautiful ingenue this middle-aged woman must have been. Her dark skin and soft, round flesh are warm and she smells of warm honey.

Faded ingenue, matriarch of the [[DuPont Duchy]] and [[Annette-Marie DuPont|Annette]]'s confidante.

- Always dressed in vivid colours.
- Always accompanied by [[Snarl]].
