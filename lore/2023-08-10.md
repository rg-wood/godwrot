> It is a common fancy of the meagre wright of the tale within the tale. The play with the play. A tired note in a frayed concerto.
>
> For once, our players are not to blame but the... other. The one who sits askance, plotting here, penning a villain there. Pulling the strings and making our party dance. What a hack.
>
> Who will save us? None. I speak out, but I doubt he listens and so...
>
> Our players find themselves seeking entertainment, joining the throng of ragged nobles seeking a seat at the Mare, for a performance of the scandalous Petty Laced Bodice.
>
> As with all things related to our players, something of great substance abounds. And who should be in attendance: supposedly the Red Swan, herself!
