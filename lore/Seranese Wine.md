> The drink of choice of [[The Dernier Masque]], it truly embodies this festival. As sweet as it is sour, sickly as it is refreshing. It brings a fervour to the mind and a subtle and not entirely unwelcome addiction. Each sup takes you further from the mundane world, bringing hallucinations and drawing you further into mania.

Seranese wine is, in fact, a form of effluvia emitted from [[Lord Legrad]], extracted by a foul method that would disgust most people of good sense.

## Appearance

An odd, milky infusion with an intoxicating taste and aroma. It comes in old wine bottles, often labelled as something else. But, there is no mistaking this vintage for anything else.

## Effects

Each bottle contains four glasses of wine. Drinking one heals 1d3 damage to an attribute of the drinkers choice

## Drawbacks

After the wine takes effect, the drinker must make an Endurance roll against a Potency 6, or falls under the sway of the strange liquor. They gain the Sleepy condition and gain a D6 Delirium resource.

When a character with the Delirium resource imbibes another glass and fails the Potency roll, the Delirium resource die goes up another step and they become Sleepy again.

Furthermore, whenever they suffer Wits or Empathy damage they must roll the resource dice as though it were an Artifact Dice. If they succeed, they are compelled to drink more serenese wine. If they don't drink immediately, roll on the following mishap table:
