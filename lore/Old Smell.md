![[Old Smell.png]]

> A cold, empty Father's Temple, square and firm. Its windows are dark, its stained-glass smashed in places. Its walls are covered in the circle and cross of the Mother and the Father, scrawled in black paint and chalk.
>
> A warren of mismatched, crumbling gravestones guard the long, rambling path to the entrance. Monuments dot the landscape, statues of angels and saints watch over the dead, heads bowed, or pleading to the heavens, marking the graves of the truly pious.

[[Old Smell]] is a deserted chapel of the [[Holy Temple of the Father]] that lies at the heart of [[Small Grave]].

- **Cursed.** The temple is deconsecrated and guarded by a number of [[Saint]]s.
- **Hellmouth.** The [[Lazarial Door]] lies beneath the chapel.

**Notes:**

- A narrow, flint pathway girds the temple.
- Stained-glass windows and narrow glass windows.
- A small, locked door at the back of the temple permits access to the crypt.

## Spire

Wooden stairs lead up the narrow spire to the bell tower. Ages ago, the ancient bell crashed into the catacombs below, causing the stairs to fall in places.

## Crypt

The crypt can be reached via:

1. Locked stairs from the chapel.
2. Climbing down a hole left by the temple bell that fell from the spire (see above).
3. By the smaller door at the back of the chapel.

The crypt itself was once an [[Old Empire]] temple to the demon [[Lazarial]]. Parts of the broken walls here have been cleaned to reveal murals of demon worship. It is damp and smells of mould.

### The Broken Bell

A large, iron bell lies broken here. It has cracked a hole in the floor of the ancient crypt, revealing a hidden set of stone steps that lead down to the [[Fane of Paths]].
