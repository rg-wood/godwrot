> As you open the double doors you are overwhelmed by the warm stench of unwashed human bodies and stale ale. The tavern is busy tonight and the bawdy music playing is drowned out by the murmurs of the dishevelled and seedy patrons, chatting, gambling and drinking amongst themselves.

**The Five Maids** is a rough establishment, named after the five fair wenches that serve its watery ale. Here you'll find hardy sailors, weary old men and other misfits who come for the ask-no-questions atmosphere and cheap drink.

On the first floor are several small rooms for rent. Covered in sawdust and straw, they can be rented for 1 gp a night as long as you don't mind sharing a squalid floor with ten other rough sleepers.

The five maids themselves do everything: serve food and drinks, cook and clean, and throw rowdier elements out if needed.

[[Big Frey]] speaks for the five maids and serves behind the counter. This stout, young women has a thick head of unruly red hair and a temper to match.

- Whilst most patrons remember [[Old Ben]], the innkeeper, they haven't seen him in a while. That's because the five maids, sick of his foul temper, murdered him one night and buried his body in the basement. For this reason, they don't let strangers down to the basement and are apt to change the subject if Old Ben comes up in conversation.
