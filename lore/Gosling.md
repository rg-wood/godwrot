Gosling was the infamous Warlock of [[Westric]].

- **One Truth.** Gosling always had one _true_ thing to say about a person
- **Wretch.** Years of torment have warped him, flesh and mind.
- **Shrewd.** Always planning his escape. Secretly manipulating [[Ser Jaye]].
- **Hysterical.** Despite his condition, Gosling is unnervingly upbeat, unfazed by threats and cruelty.
- **Lascivious.** Saucy in no small amount, and enjoys disturbing lasses with winks of his witch eye.

**History:**

1. Youngest brother born to a goose farmer.
2. As a child Gosling's eye was plucked from his head and replaced with that of a demon's by the [[Hawthorne Circle]].
3. Was kept as pet seer to the [[Westric]] nobles.
4. The [[Mad Bishop of Dismas]] caught wind of this and had his masters executed.
5. Now he finds himself held in servitude again, this time by the [[Witchfinders]] who use his powers to divine other witches.

Things Gosling knows:

- What is making that sound at the bottom of [[The Shaft]].
