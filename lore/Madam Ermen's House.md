![[Map of Madame Ermen's House.png]]

Large town house that sits on [[Crabs Row]], home of [[Madam Ermen]] who rattles about its empty rooms by herself.

- **Shrouded.** All the mirrors in the house are covered.

**Locations:**

- **Basement.**
  - Filled to the ankles with saltwater.
  - [[Dismas Catacombs]] can be accessed by anyone diving into the waters and passing through a narrow grate in the floor.
- **Ground Floor.**
  - **Hallway.** An old **ship's masthead** hangs over the staircase.
    - On closer inspection the maid carved into the masthead bears a resemblance to [[Madam Ermen]].
  - **Dining Room.** Large table from which Madame Ermen serves her putrid food.
  - **Kitchen.** The smell of putrid food here is overpowering. A small door opens onto narrow stone steps that lead down to the basement.
- **1st Floor.**
  - [[The Vestal's Sanctum]].
  - **Ermen's Chambers.** The bed is covered in dust and looks as though no one has used it for decades.
- **2nd Floor.**
  - **Room full of fine clothes** hung from the ceiling or dress on mannequins.
  - **Disused library** containing the following useful books:
    - _A Thrift-full Accounting of the Imperfect Human Form_ by [[Phillius]] (Marksmanship).
    - _Songs of the Wendsworth Goblins_ by unknown (Cold Blooded)
    - _The Spuniform Lullabies_ by unknown (Firm Grip).
- **Attic.**
  - **Dormer windows nailed shut** give access to the rooftops of the surrounding buildings.
  - **Statues covered in dust sheets** are actually the brittle husks of [[Madam Ermen]]'s old bodies.
