> A lamp is on in the bookshop, flickering behind the bottle glass windows. The light glimmers all the colours of the glasses… rich, wine wed, luminous green, and baleful blue.

This shop of obscure books is a front for a [[Flock]] safe house. A set of stairs hidden behind the shelves leads up to hidden rooms.

- Smells of schnapps and dust.

**History:**

1. Hideout for [[Lia]], [[Red]], [[Cadfyre]] and [[Landon]].
2. Deserted during the [[Sparrow's Purge]].
