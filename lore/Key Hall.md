The head quarters of the [[Locksmith's Guild]]. This grand building sits comfortably in the middle of a row of wealthy merchant houses, offices and other grand establishments. Elaborate, stained-glass windows sport locks and keys instead of angels and saints. It’s walls are adorned with formal icons decorated with impressive mottos and royal seals. The most impressive of which is the a Silver Key, the symbol of the Locksmith’s Guild!
