Naive is secretly the Vestal, a [[Black Hand]] witch posing as the rather unpleasant Abbess off [[Whittock Priory]]. She lacks the imagination of her sisters in the Hand, and deceives poorly.

- **Witch's mark:** Her tongue is pitch black.
- **Intonement magic:** When Naive speaks with her booming voice even the angels take notice.
- **Secret:** Plots to kill [[The Plenary]] and replace her.
- **Frustrated:**
  - Constantly bemoans the loss of her last, luxurious assignment at [[Faro Palace]].
  - Wants the [[Black Hand]] to take a more direct approach.
- **Bodyguard.** Always accompanied by [[Sister Quietude]].
- **Close Ally:** There is a 3-in-6 chance (`dice:1d6`) Sister Naive is encountered with [[The Widow]].
- **Hand Speaker:** The Vestal acts as intermediary between [[Hell]] and the [[Black Hand]].
