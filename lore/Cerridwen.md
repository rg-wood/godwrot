![[Cerridwen.png|300]]

> A short woman with voluminous chestnut hair, wearing a very stained apron over a plain linen dress. She bears an iron chain fastened closely about her neck. One might think it a necklace, except it seems to have no clasp or other means to remove it.

Cerridwen is a kindly and likeable healer from the [[Grey Woald]], indentured to [[Gerrin]] and [[House de Clare]] by the [[Ibastus Order]].
