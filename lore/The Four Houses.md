#location

[[The Four Houses]] is a large mansion that was constructed by linking four smaller houses together. Originally a slum, it is now the sumptuous home of [[The Merchant]], and the headquarters of the [[Kastenburg Cartel]].

> A set of four houses rise above the surrounding slums, connected by a haphazard network of passages and makeshift bridges so that they form a greater mansion, all covered in strangling ivy vines.

[[The Princes]] are [[The Merchant]]'s new headquarters and personal palace, recently inhabited as his criminal empire expands across [[The Land]]. It consists of four buildings named after minor [[Southron Kingdoms]] nobility: The Prince Horis, The Prince Utter, The Prince Oyer and The Princess Swaress.
