**Location:** [[Fane of Paths]]

[[King Lyonid]] has agreed to a secret marriage with the recently widowed [[The Widow|Baroness Malignon]] ([[The Widow]] in disguise, now that [[The Countess]] is dead). This is actually a trap, and [[King Lyonid]] will be subjected to a ritual so he can be possessed by [[Denarial]], allowing the demon to manifest physically in the mortal world.

[[The Marriage Phlegm and Sanguine]] is an alchemical ritual designed to allow powerful demons to leave [[Hell]] and possess a willing host. It is being cast near a crack in the [[Lazarial Door]].
