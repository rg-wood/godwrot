#encounter

**Goals:** Information on [[Sylas]]
**Position:** -2 (more people, nothing to gain)

[[Ser Jaye]] (with [[Remember-Well]] and [[Gosling]]) is suspicious of [[Sylas]] and is carefully watching his contacts and **blackmails** them into infiltrating the [[Half-World]] for information.

- Ser Jaye has begun to suspect that there is something rotten in [[Privy Council]].
- Has observed that [[Sylas]] always seems to be in the middle of things.
- [[Just Benedict]], [[The Quellerian]] and the [[Red Swan]].
- Knows the next location of the [[Troigard]].
- Knows the [[Red Swan]] has been seen frequenting [[Whittock Priory]].
- [[Just Benedict]] is dull witted and easy to manipulate.
