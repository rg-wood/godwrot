These ordinary-looking, gold coins have been stolen and then blessed by [[🗡 Dismas Remade/The Bastard|The Bastard]].

## Effects

Tossed into the shadows as an offering, this creates a temporary (1d4 rounds) portal through the [[Shadowside]] to a destination of the bearers choosing. The destination must be somewhere the bearer has already seen, and that is also shrouded in darkness.

## Drawbacks

Once used, a shadow coin disappears, taken to [[The Bastard's Count]]. The coins are considered sacred by the [[Cult of the Bastard]], and they will do all in their power to retrieve them from the unworthy.
