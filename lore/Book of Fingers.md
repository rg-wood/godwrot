The Book of Fingers is the religious text of the [[Cult of the Bastard]]. It contains the litany of The Bastard as well as a description of secret Thieves' Cant symbols, unknown to even most thieves.

It is written on pages blotted black, in a sacred ink that can only be read in pitch darkness. Once revealed, every page seems to contain foul language and course jokes.

This is a second layer of misdirection: the text is peppered with Thieves' Cant code which contains the actual text of the book.
