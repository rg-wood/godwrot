#encounter

While passing through the [[South Docks]] the party notice seagulls flocking inland. If they approach they find the burned corpse of a communard, seagulls picking at his flesh. In his right hand he holds a large bag filled with weapons, warped by flame. Searching his body uncovers a bronze medallion emblazoned (13 HP, grants entrance to the commune), a lump of silver the 'twas coins (11 SP) and a singed map of [[Dismas Catacombs]] that leads under the [[South Docks Commune]].
