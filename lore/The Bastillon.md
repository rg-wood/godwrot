#settlement

The otherwise nameless prison-town known only as The Bastillon, where political prisoners are kept. It is left to its own devices and has become a copy-in-minature of the cruelty and inequality of pre-Commonwealth civilisation. Deposed nobles grasp at what power they had before they were captured, lording over their "lessers" and warring with their neighbours. Entire tinpot kingdoms come and go within its walls.

Many wonder if the Commonwealth is too generous allowing its old enemies to remain alive and there are rumours that the quarrelsome factions within the town are beginning to put aside their differences so they can stage an escape.
