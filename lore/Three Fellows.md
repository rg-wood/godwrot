Once a popular inn, the Three Fellows is now under reconstruction and is being turned into a [[New Commonwealth]] community centre, offering free shelter, food and medical care for refugees from the south.

1. Was turned into a gatehouse and depot by [[Mandatory Forces]].
2. Was turned into a community centre after [[Nunstable]] was liberated during the [[Forward Push 2]].
