#encounter

**Key stat:** Empathy (uh oh)

[[Lia]] travels through the [[Abyss]] to [[The Bastard's Count]] to demand an audience with [[🗡 Dismas Remade/The Bastard|The Bastard]].

> A pile of coins and valuables, tarnished and dulled by the Abyss, rises before you. Sitting on top is a familiar figure, a young man, dressed handsomely in black, with thick, black hair cut into a mullet. His face is expressionless as he counts his coins with his one good hand: the other cut off in a straight line at the elbow.

- [ ] **Impatient.** Growing weary of [[Lia]]'s hypocrisy.
- [ ] **Powerless.** He is powerless over the [[Dimlit bracelet]].
- [ ] **Unsympathetic.** Unfair is being banished to the torture's of the Abyss for all eternity.
- [ ] **False Offer.** Whatever [[🗡 Dismas Remade/The Bastard|The Bastard]] offers (a part of his count, a new face, etc.) he has no reason to fulfil the bargain.
