![[Dismas Map.png]]

Ancient Dismas. Capital of the [[Midlands]]. The City that Eats Itself. A blistering canker on the arse of the [[Easterly Sea]]. A corrupt miser gnawing at its own bones. Its streets run black with filth. A wretched beggar on every corner.

Now riven by war. Two factions divide Dismas. The city north of the [[River Hy]] has been taken by the [[Commonwealth Army]] in a fiery siege. Only [[South Dismas]] remain loyal to the [[Three Kings]]. An uneasy truce abides, about which spies, profiteers, and mercenaries swarm like flies.

Beneath the city sprawl the infamous sewers, tunnels and dungeons of [[Dismas Catacombs]], where thieves, beggars and darker things lurk, shying away from the light of the overcity.
