A travelling scribe who discovered the secret of making [[Faronian papyrus]] and saved the city's fortunes. Elfreda day is still celebrated every year in Faro on the spring solstice. Cards - literally folded sheets of blank (unwritten) papyrus - are given to friends and neighbours to celebrate this feast day.
