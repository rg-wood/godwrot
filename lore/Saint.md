> A sun-washed statue, mottled with lichen, its heavy-lidded eyes lifted heavenwards, hands raised in supplication. Paternal crosses and maternal icons hang from chains around its neck and waist. With a horrendous scraping sound, it moves, its limbs along great cracks at its joints, to allow it to step forwards, lower its arms and turn towards you.

"Saints" are the statues of holy men and women, possessed and animated by [[Demon]]s.
