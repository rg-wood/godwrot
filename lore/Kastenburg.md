[[Southron Kingdoms]]' slum town, held in thrall to [[Dismas]]'s opium trade.

## History

Though once prosperous, the trade route city of Kastenburg has since become a slum town. With little natural resources in the immediate area (beyond the fairly low yield salt mines), the once proud city of Kastenburg has since become little more than a trade stop for merchants seeking to avoid the more wild passes through the [[Burgendorf Hills]]. Beyond acting as a rest stop, the economy of Kastenburg is largely propped up by low level banditry, and through ‘tourism’ - as the cities silk taverns offer unrivalled ‘services’ to cater for every taste for those with more coin than morals. An additional source of income is the abundance of hempweed poppies that grow in vast fields around ‘the scrag’ to the west of the city. The fumes of the crushed hempweed poppy, when inhaled, is said to heighten the senses, whilst simultaneously acting as a hallucinogenic and creating a feeling of euphoria. As a result this poppy is in wide use in the silk taverns of Kastenburg - imbibed as it is by both clients, looking to experience an other-worldly fantasy, and by the workers of those taverns looking to escape their real-world hell. ‘Escape’ many of the imbibers do - for it is said that inhaling the vapours of this plant can drive a man (or woman) insane, and there is ample evidence of the truth in this rumour in the alleyways and darkened corners of filthy Kastenburg .

Though ostensibly under the jurisdiction of [[House Castantis]], in reality Kastenburg is governed with an iron fist by a council of merchant lords who between them control the silk taverns, the saltweed poppy farms and what passes for the local lawmen. The law abiding folk of the city are overworked and overtaxed and poverty is evident in every alleyway. With multiple councilmen claiming the right to amend or even issue laws on the fly, the populace is oppressed by an ever changing legal landscape that fines them at every perceived wrong turn.

Once foremost of the independent south western city states, now Kastenburg is an unpleasant and dirty city with an ever burgeoning slum district. Though the merchant lords of the [[Kastenburg Council]] maintain a guard of some 1,000 troops, the quality of these hired swords varies from poorly armed gutter thugs forced into service in lieu of prison sentencing, to poorly equipped and even more poorly paid, but capable, professional soldiers. Although in theory at least [[Queen Hielwinn Castantis]] could call upon the loyalty of these troops should she need them, in reality most couldn’t be relied on to not melt away back into the lives they’d led before being press ganged into the city guard.

Queen Hielwin Castantis (the third) of House Castantis has recently been sending expeditions to [[The Crag]] in an attempt to burn down the poppy fields but has met with fierce resistance both on the field and at home. Recently there was an attempt on her newborn son’s life which has made her rethink her​ ‘’[[Kastenburg Strategy]]’’​.
