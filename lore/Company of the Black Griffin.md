**Status:** Disbanded during the [[Siege of Dismas]]
**Symbol:** Crest worn on the shoulder and shields: a rampant, black griffin on a gold background.

The Company of the Black Griffin is a mercenary army commanded by the ageing [[Captain Larke]]. For a century now it has journeyed east, seeking fortune and glory and collecting recruits from across the known world.

A new age demands a new kind of warfare. Gone are the old rules of engagement. Where once courage and bravery held the day, victory now belongs to the most ruthless. The Black Griffins epitomise this contemporary fashion and they have never been in such demand. The nobles that hire them may despise their foul reputation, but cannot deny they win the day.

## Fetches

Griffin Company tolerates many crimes except one: desertion. In years past, company commanders would form small parties of fetches (bounty hunters) to bring deserters to justice.

Fetches were so useful they became a permanent part of the company. Now they are used for all kinds of off-the-book work, such as espionage, sabotage and even assassination.
