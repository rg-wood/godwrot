#session

Red:

> We draw back our curtain and observe... naught! 'Tis darkness, within which can be the heard the grunts and blows of a melee. Most peculiar.
>
> The audience squints into the dark corners of the stage. A flicker here, a scuffle there.
>
> A stage hand draws a candle, and we spy a melee. Our old standby, Red, struggles with an opponent as yet unseen...

Lia:

> A treat after our Interlude. Behold, the Cathedral Umbral! Behold, the Pageantry of Coronation of the King of Shadows! Behold Irsist Himself!
>
> The darkened of the main chamber flit with shades, murmuring in their whispered tones, at once scandalised and delighted by Lia's presence.
