A prosperous merchants district, now a cramped haven for noble refugees, displaced by the [[Commoner Revolution]].

> A pall hangs over this once-bright quarter. It's limestone buildings are now stained with soot, and its shining cobbles fouled with mud, and worse. Shrapnel marks pepper the buildings, and about those old manses newer buildings have been hastily assembled, made of darker stone or grey wood.

- Group SCOUTING check for someone to notice that a number of the people here have the [[Star Sickness]], and are caked in makeup to cover their greenish skin.
