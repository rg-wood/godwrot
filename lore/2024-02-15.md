| 12.30am | [[Sister Naive]] blames [[Sister Persistence]] for keeping the [[Adjunctive Verboten]] secret.                                                                                                |
|         | [[Droop]] eavesdrops on the parties' conversation on the street (opposed check SCOUTING succeeded).                                                                                           |
|         | [[Lia]] notices [[Droop]] and is subtle enough (opposed Manipulation/Insight check succeeded) not to let Droop know he's been made. The party are not aware the watcher is someone they know. |
| 12.32am | The party tie up [[Sister Quietude]] and [[Sister Naive]] and put them in Red Swan's carriage.                                                                                                |
