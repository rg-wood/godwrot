> _A baker’s dozen of dawns have passed since the balestar ascended to the heavens, and Dismas has returned to a semblance of its wretched normalcy. While the star still glowers in the night sky, its aura is oppressive rather than harmful._
>
> _A disturbing omen rather than death and disorder._
>
> _As for our fellows-in-arms, we find them supping the dishwater ale served in the infamous Cockascrew Hostelry. About them, punters squawk and strut, regardless of any possible, impending apocalypse. Or despite it._

| 9.30pm   | The party see Commonwealth agents being burned at the stake.<br>Cadfyre fails to sway the crowd. |

> _Cadfrye stands before a crowd, turning into a mob before his eyes. Flames burn, clouds of smoke choke, embers flying into the night sky, the stench of cooking flesh in the air._

> _Lia and Red look on in horror, blood draining from their faces, stones in their bellies._
>
> _Another cry of “HERESY”_
>
> _Someone else starts chanting “FOR THE FOLK! FOR THE FOLK!”_
>
> _And then riot runs free. Bricks start to fly. Fire spreads to a nearby wagon. Soldiers start forming lines and slamming into people. And the witch finders start to push their way towards Cadfyre…_

| 11pm     | [[Cadfyre]] encounters a raconteur from [[The Dernier Masque]] |

> _It is a poor job to walk the faire roads of Dismas alone. Especially so betwixt dusk and dawn. Yet, our merry player, Cadfyre, has undertaken just such an endeavour._

> _It is said of certain in life, is only death! And his sister, tithe. And so, our players have fallen afoul of a ravenous band of tax collectors. Keen for their share of a levy they do not - perhaps - have any true right to._
>
> _But in these ages of war, there are many mouths in want of feeding. And many eyes looking enviously upon gold. While the Three Kings are confounded with the business of battle, there is no one to watch and so corruption seeps in like a weeping canker on a catamite’s arse._

> _The_ [[Vie de l'agent]] _is considered a wretched one, in truth. Lurking down streets unlit. Mumming affection for knaves and scoundrels._
>
> _And making perilous climbs. A rejoiner with our players as they attend their rendezvous with_ Conseil des Voleurs*. A meeting of great import. Without which, our courageous movement might be undone.*
>
> _Can our players make agreement? Let’s us watch on._

> \*Is there any material more virtuous than humble rope? A stalwart of the world o’commerce. It carries sugars, spices, even ships whole across seas. It elevates men and waters.
>
> - _We draw the curtains ‘pon our merry fellows standing at the foot of such a virtuous rope. A long meandering agreement has at last been reached, and so they begin their ascent._

> _Once again, our players are afflicted with the fearsome foe of any playwright: the parting of ways. Separation. A surfeit of places asunder. ‘Tis true, the heart grows fonder._

[[Red]] and [[Cadfyre|Cad]]:

> _As is their favour, we rejoin weary Red and dissolute Cadfyre as they partake of their favourite time to pass: the torture of folk._
>
> _What information will they glean? Will it matter? Let us spy…_

[[Lia]] and [[Landon]]:

> _And where are Lia and Landon? As they stumble around in the darkness, ‘tis hard to say. Surely, not upon the surface. But if not above, where below? Some of the other opportunities may be quite afrightening._
>
> _And so, we are struck by the bizarre circumstances: Landon a victim of a foul trap, now a prisoner. With only foul Flea for company._
>
> _With Lia spying upon the strange goings-on about in the gloom. Can they escape? One doubts, but all is possible…_

[[Red]] and [[Cadfyre|Cad]]:

> _We join a half set of players, as Red and Cadfyre perform an examination of a strange book. Requisitioned from their mysterious captive._
>
> _Though seemingly a tabula rasa, words appear in the deep darkness before their eyes…_

[[Lia]] and [[Landon]]:

> _For Lia, life seems like one prison after another. Kastenberg was like a gaol, not easily escaped. The bonds formed in Black Griffins led to disaster, dragging Lia along with them._
>
> _And so, our player finds herself in yet another cage. This one deep in the darkness, somewhere, anywhere underground._
>
> _Before her and her comrade in arms, Landon, stands the ugliest man she’s ever seen. Does he seem familiar? The thought quickly vanishes from her mind as he intones the words…_

[[Red]] and [[Cadfyre|Cad]]:

> _In many ways, Dismas is alike a cat’s cradle. A tangle of lives, clasped in the grip of a withered hag. As our players are finding out._
>
> _Evidence of cultish activity has established itself to our dissolute drunkard and weary witch keeper. Signs with signs, a new cant leading to a lair. A search is on._
>
> But no trip through the night of the city is without tribulation. Is that a small figure in the fog? Is that the sound of weeping?\*

[[Lia]] and [[Landon]]:

> _Freedom is hard-earned and easily lost. For our players, Lia and Landon, it has been won, but could soon be squandered._
>
> _Of all the beasts to encounter beneath the ground, one could never guess at crying mule. As it expresses its fright, running footsteps draw close…_

[[Red]] and [[Cadfyre|Cad]]:

> _We rejoin our players as they acquire a foundling, a child, lost in the warren of streets and alleys that is Foul Dismas._
>
> _And so, the hunt continues, for lost Landon and Lia, and the Black Shrine…_

> _Unity. In direction and location. A virtue, we say, long looked far and seldom found. Yet, our players seem strangely adverse to this condition. Always pairing in perverse paths._
>
> _However - as in most things - they are confounded in this repulsion and have somehow stumbled upon each other once again._
>
> _And, of course, in circumstances of a very unfortunate nature, even for themselves. A black shrine. A bridge. A charnel pit. Hanging censors sway in the ever-so-light breeze, wet and close._

> _A dance above a charnel pit. A flash of thief steel in the flickering torchlight. A jacket slashed, revealing a line of crimson beneath._
>
> _Our players are arrayed before us, as though upon a board of chess, mismatched. A pit below. Bisected by a bridge above._
>
> _At one end, two bastard cultists fire arrows. In the middle, Cadfyre and Landon are engaged with two more curs._
>
> _Retreat is cut off by the party’s erstwhile prisoner, now liberated from his fetters and keen for revenge._
>
> _And below, Lia and Red languish amidst the red and bone gristle of the pit itself._
>
> _Death is a vast pit, a gaping emptiness within which we are all being drawn. Slow. Quick. The destination nary varies. Just the appointed hour._
>
> _Our party are descending, perhaps, faster than most. To prove this point, we find them knee-deep in the loins, arms, torsos and heads of long dead strangers. A charnel pit, no less._
>
> _Knives fly, allies harried, and an escape presents itself. Can our players recover themselves and ascend the stone steps they have happened upon? Or will they simply be more gristle for the pile around them?_
