#session

> Our scene: a new dawn alights Dismas, the baleful star sets and grey clouds smother skies. Cold winds blow in off the Easterly Sea, rattling windows and scattering gulls as they doth pass.
>
> We find our players crawling through the empty rooms of Madame Ermen's house, gathering their bones, collecting thoughts and taking measures.
>
> What is their next move? Will they employ the use of stratagem, or rather make of with Lady Fortune, hussy of fate, instead?
>
> Let us sssssssssee....
