#location

> This rambling edifice bristles with towers, domes and spires, all half-finished and covered in scaffolding. Rafters and joists gape from great masonry wounds. Despite the incompleteness not a single carpenter or labourer can be seen.

The cathedral itself, centre of worship of [[The Father]] and the [[Mad Bishop of Dismas]]'s seat of power. From here the entire city of [[Dismas]] is administered by the bishop's army of religious clerks, witchfinders, priests and minor bishops.
