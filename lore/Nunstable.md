![[Nunstable Map.svg]]

A forest of smoke plumes rise above the town, a sign of the constant industry here. Hammering and shouting can be heard at all times of the day and night.

Once a sleepy market town, Nunstable has changed hands over the last few years, from [[Mandatory Forces]] outpost to liberated, [[New Commonwealth]] industrial town.

1. Was commandeered by [[Mandatory Forces]] during the [[Commoner Revolution]] and became the Town Requisitioned, a fortified base of operation supporting [[The Front]].
2. Location of the [[Nunstable Massacre]].
3. Liberated by the [[Commonwealth Army]].
