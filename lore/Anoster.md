> Anoster is a great bear of a man. You can see what appears to be a tonsure on his head, which hasn't quite grown out yet.

Owner of [[Anoster's bookshop]] and [[New Commonwealth]] sympathiser. He is a great bibliophile with a deep, gravely voice, a gentle soul and a fondness for schnapps.

**Notes:**

- Caretaker of [[Sylas the Cat]].
- Has a crush on [[Wooden-Eye Sally]].
- Chuckles to himself a lot.

**History:**

1. He was a monk but was defrocked for heresy.
2. Turning alcoholic after witnessing the [[Witchfinder attack on Sally]] and having to leave the bookshop for the [[Dismas Night Market]].
3. Living in [[The Gull's Nest]] while [[Anoster's bookshop]] is unsafe to return to.
