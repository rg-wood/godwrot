| 1   | **DARK REFLECTION!** Red Swan offers a NEAR or closer adventurer a glimpse of their own reflection with her pocket mirror, offering a unpleasant revelation. The target suffers a fear attack with 10 base die.                                                                        |
| 2   | **INFLECTION!** Red Swan flashes her pocket mirror and steals the reflection of the adventurer. The target suffers a fear attack with 10 base die. On a successful attack, the adventurer can no longer see their own reflection and, with a FAST action, Red Swan can appear as them. |
| 3   | **SUDDEN KNIFE!** Out of nowhere, the Red Swan produces a knife and stabs a NEAR or closer adventurer, who suffers an attack with 8 Base Dice and Weapon Damage 2.                                                                                                                     |
| 4   | **FLURRY OF SLASHES!** Red Swan strikes at the adventurer with a flurry of her rapier, with an attack with 8 Base Dice and Weapon Damage 2, and the adventurer is SHOVED to the ground.                                                                                                |
| 5   | **STEAL SIGHT!** Red Swan flashes her pocket mirror and steals the sight of a NEAR adventurer. For 1d6 rounds they are blind. See Darkness effects on pg. 112. The Red Swan can see through the eyes of the adventurer at will for the duration of this effect.                        |
| 6   | **CHARM!** Targets one non-blind adventurer within SHORT range. The target must succeed an INSIGHT roll or cannot attack Red Swan. They can make another INSIGHT roll to resist after their next initiative. An ally can try to break it with a slow action PERFORMANCE roll.          |
