#location

> The building is upside-down. Below lies the ceiling, and above the floor. Everything is broken, dark and still. Shattered glass litters the ceiling and its wood panel walls are slashed.

A seemingly abandoned building in the [[Shadowside]]. It hangs upside down, with its floors as ceilings and its ceilings as floors.
