> A large woman, heavy of arm and leg, doughy of face. She wears a Father's circle on a chain about her neck.

Twinnings is [[Droop]]'s trusted second, and an original member of [[The Grapevine]] orphans. She is superstitiously religious, and constantly begs the Father's forgiveness. She makes a great show of selflessness, but is in fact quite selfish.
