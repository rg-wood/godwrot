![[Cathedrale Temporal Map.png]]

> Imposing brick walls rise up, beyond which the domes and spires of the cathedral itself can be glimpsed.

Within:

> Beyond the outer walls stands the cathedral itself, but before that are the ramblings grounds around it. Here smaller chapels and temples sprawl, surrounded by gardens, stables, towers, shrines, wells, squares and all manner of things.

The Cathedrale Temporal is the seat of the [[Archbishopric of Dismas]]. Its walled grounds are so large it is a district unto itself.
