#adventure #session

**Season:** Autumn

> _It has been a full annum since the events of the Siege of Dismas. The city is divided. An uneasy truce abides._
>
> _And so we find our players - fey Lia and stout Red - situated in Salt Gate. Here, slums crowd, fed by an influx of refugees. All penned between the failing walls of the Inner City and the cold waters of the Grey Sea._
>
> _Similarly, our players find themselves kept. Furnished with a comfortable stipend, they have been largely left to their own devices._
>
> _The lingering suspicion they’re still being watch is confirmed when a wretched street performer waylays them. A strange puppet show is performed, in which two characters (bearing a striking likeness to players) meet a yellow parrot in a rowdy tavern. Run by a chicken. For some reason._
>
> _It can only be a message from the Flock._
>
> _And so Lia and Red find themselves outside the Cockaskew Hostelry, on a misty, Autumnal night. Ready to meet their contact._

> **FOWL ARE NOT PERMITTED**
> **BY ORDER OF THE PUBLICAN**
> **NO CHICKENS, DUCKS, AND SO FORFH**
