#location

A food stall sits at this junction, filled with **bubbling pots and sizzling pans**. Roll BEAST + FOOD (pg. 53 of _The Perilous Wilds Revised Edition_) to determine what each dish might be.

[[Cyssie du Duck]] runs the stall here, keeping watch, and giving the nod to the court guards. She can call 2d4 [[Ruffians]] if, for example, anyone tries to enter Creed's Court (7).

⊙ Unofficial kitchen for the Night Market.
➔ East: Passage to The Market Itself (4).
➔ South: Large double-doors (shut) to Creed's Court (7).
