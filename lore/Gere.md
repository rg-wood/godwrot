Here is the identical twin brother of [[Here]]. Ex-privates of the now disbanded [[Company of the Black Griffin]], they have become estranged from each other.

The twins are painfully thin, young lads no more than sixteen summers, or so.

- Picaresque rogue.
- Shrewd shirker.
- Missing his brother.
- Finishes [[Gere]]'s sentences and talks over him.
- Disdain for [[Lia]], [[Orin]] and [[Red]].

**Notes:**

- After the [[Siege of Dismas]], escaped the city and travelled south.
- Encountered the [[Rhotlings]] at the [[??? Inn]] (see _[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17H6gfB7t10lJTLedOPveTkAZ-8fK29zBE81YvnOKHCU)_).
