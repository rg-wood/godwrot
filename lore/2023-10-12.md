> Forgive the interlude. Foolish injury has separated your narrator from your goody selves, our blessed and unwavering audiences.
>
> And what of our play? To whit, a menu of deeds (or misdeeds?) from our first half:
>
> A conspiracy of agents for our players to deal with as they see fit.
>
> A new measure, a fine promotion. Our party are to be wedded to the task of dancing with black magic.
>
> A plot to marry in secret and shore up the wavering companionship of the Three Kings.
>
> Renewed activity from an old friend, the unusual and fantastic child, Sylas. Of which the Sparrow is most of interest.
>
> A contact in the Half World: Just Benedict who can be found at the edge of the Embers.
>
> A billet for a night at the theatre.
>
> An encounter with an old acquaintance, the Red Swan herself.
>
> An affair and a betrayal of the heart.
>
> And so, we return to our scribe's perhaps unrealistic ambitions: a play within a play. We join our party as the curtain draws on "The Petty Laced Bodice."
