#item

The opening between life and death is not a door, but a weapon that beats the dead back from the world of the living. The Ashen Gate is a heavy, leaden stave that wields the power to keep the living separate from the dead. There are 10 of these, each given to chosen [[Psychopomp]]s.

An Ashen Gate is highly coveted and it is said [[Plutonus]] wields one.

## Effects

The Ashen Gate can control and turn undead, as well as paralyse those it strikes.
