#district

Silver Gate is named after the grand portal that sits at the edge of this district, one of the four major entrances to [[Dismas]].

It is one of the few safe routes in and out of the city, and has become a important supply line for [[Mandatory Forces]]. As such, the district has become a hive of military activity, dotted by supply depots , entertainments catering to soldiers and other illicit businesses taking advantage of the chaos.
