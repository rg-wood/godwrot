**Chapter:** [[Roots]]

> We see our players depart from a near brush with disaster. They hobble back, tails betwixt legs to the nest within Little Covet

> Lia and Red negotiate the rickety ladders and makeshift bridges across the rooftops of Little Covet, and finally open the door to the precarious rooms they live in, and open the door to the smell of cooking oats and sour liquor vapours.

> Anoster morosely hunches over the small stove in the corner where a large pot bubbles, carefully nursing some kind of porridge.
