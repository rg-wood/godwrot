#location

> A long, wide thoroughfare that stretches from a vast gatehouse to a towering keep standing on the shores of the Easterly Sea. About parade an endless, swirling stream of merchants, sailors, palanquins, pedlars, minstrels, tumblers, catamites, brahmins, preachers and so forth and so on. Now two figures alike, a hundred languages in the air.
>
> Despite its marvels, it lingers with the sickly sweet odour of putrid fish, and sweet spices and perfumes

This cosmopolitan street separated from Dismas proper and the various merchants, sailors and assorted travellers who pass through city by boat.
