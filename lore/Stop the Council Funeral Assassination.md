Tensions between the [[Thieves' Council of Dismas|Thieves' Council of Dismas]] and [[The Grapevine]] still run high after the [[Negotiation between the Grapevine and the Council]], despite [[Night Queen Creed]]'s proclamation that none shall a raise a hand against the bastard cultists.

There are rumours that renegade Bastard [[Cultist]]s are planning to assassinate [[Cyssie du Duck]] as she performs the upcoming [[Night Market Mass Funeral]] for the dead of [[The Grapevines attack on the Night Market]].

**Goal:** The party must find out the size of the conspiracy and protect [[Cyssie du Duck]].

**Notes:**

- In reality the assassination is being plotted by [[Munder]] as a false-flag.
