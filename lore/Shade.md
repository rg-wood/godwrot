Shades (sometimes just "shadows") are literally the shadows of living creatures who inhabit the [[Shadowside]] where they live as slaves to creatures of the [[Mortal Realm]], to whom they are cursed to copy.

- **Varied.** They can come in many sizes and shapes, from human-form to the minor shadows of dogs and flies.
- **Unmoored.** When sundered from their "hosts", either by death or other misfortune, they become free to roam the [[Shadowside]].
- **Jealous.** While not all are loyal to [[🗡 Dismas Remade/The Bastard|The Bastard]] most are jealous of "lightsiders" and seek to tear down the wall between [[Mortal Realm]].
- **Quiet.** Most shades can barely speak at all, and those who can may only whisper at most. Only the most powerful shades can make themselves heard across a room.
