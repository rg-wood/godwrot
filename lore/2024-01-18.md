#session

**Chapter:** [[Roots]]

> To bring our entertainment tonight we find our players arrived at a nunnery in a carriage (stolen), a dead body within, in the dead of night, and only what little wits they have left about them.
>
> As promised (by a mysterious voice echoing from a looking glass) the gates are unchained and all is quiet.
>
> We await with breath baited with curiosity, as our players tentatively step forward.
