#location

> A dreary hole, its gloom obscuring a crowd of unhappy and contemptuous clientele. A giant head hangs over the bar, crowned by a constellation of candles. Generations of which have covered the skull in a thick layer of melted wax.

A tavern and a true den of scoundrels. Even the inhabitants to the [[Dismas Night Market|Night Market]] think twice about entering.

- Old thieves line the bar swapping old stories and glaring at anyone who enter.
- Serves foul sewer-gin in pewters.
- [[Droop]], [[Twinnings]] and their coterie keep a table here for themselves.
