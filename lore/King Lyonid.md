![[King Lyonid.png|250]]

> The young man is the handsomest creature you've ever seen, long, black, curling locks frame the foxy-like features of his face. Deep, brown eyes shine above perfect cheekbones. His tailored jacket and breeches perfectly fit his form, showing off the slight swell of his belly and firm calves. His only flaw: the fingers on his right hand appear to be gnarled and twisted.

One of the [[Three Kings]], Lyonid was a prince of [[Dorshire]] before it was over-run by the [[New Commonwealth]]. Despite his young age, he was placed on the throne in-absentis as child-king in exile.

- **Obsequious.** Despite his reputation as a devious psychopath, Lyonid is actually an obsequious wimp, completely out of his depth.
