> As always been have it been so, the truest play is oftentimes off the stage. Mummers fight over much desirable roles, scribes squabble like hens over scraps and stage hands... well, who is sure what they do?
>
> Yet, surely the misfortunes, tragedies and (infrequent) joys that doest run through the streets eclipse any petty plot (or grudge) a scribe (particularly this one) might devise.
>
> Indeed, the cobbles behind our venue are shores upon which our players have run aground, victims of the machinations of the Red Swan.
>
> And so the show must proceed, in disorder. So we join Red as another show continues unabated...
