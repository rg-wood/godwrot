[[Just Benedict]]'s occult bookshop that teeters at the edge of [[The Embers]], one of the few buildings left of old [[Riverhithe]].

![[The Kough Library.png]]

> This decrepit building leans over the edge of the Embers, its walls blackened by the conflagration that burned only a year ago.

> Inside the cloying smell of mould fights with the choking smell of the Embers, an odour at once rotten and burnt. Incense burns, but it only sweetens the sickening smell.
>
> The building has been gutted, stairs and floors ripped out so that shelves can be stacked and stacked with books, all the way up to the attic. Ladders and makeshift walkways curl around the staircases, granting access to the tomes.
