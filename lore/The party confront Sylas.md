#encounter

[[Sylas]] is still seeking [[De Mysteria Ignis]] and sees an opportunity with the party. If they confont him, he will let slip that he's after something from the [[Thorn Library]] and it lies somewhere in [[Whittock Priory]]. He will then follow the party and let them lead him to the tome.
