#session

> This night we draw our tattered curtain to reveal the establishment of a Madame Ermen, who seemingly wanders its empty rooms 'til interrupted by Sister Naive.
>
> A strange place to seek haven, but options are slimmer than usual.
>
> But what of Lia and her summoning? Complacency can be deadly with the worlds unseen. What has the shadow witch wrought?
>
> We shall see...

> Red is somewhat confused for a moment. Lia's shadow passes across the carriage as though she were passing behind but, when Red turns, no one is there.
