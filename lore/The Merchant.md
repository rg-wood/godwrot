The Merchant is the vicious and powerful crime-lord of [[Kastenburg]] who forced [[Lia]] to work for him. He seems to know something about the [[Dimlit bracelet]].

- **Sadistic.** Blinds his victims and leave gold coins in the sockets.
- **Cautious.** It's rare that he deals with any but his inner circle directly.
- **The Eyes.** His signature is to take the eyes of his victims.

**History:**

1. Blinded [[Mother Maude]].

> Idk, I'm kind of imagining him as someone that's got a lot of like, business canny and is smart about people, comes across as quite charismatic, and has a lot of connections, but he doesn't get his hands dirty. Like, if he's gonna beat someone up, he'll get one of his bodyguards to do it, or rely heavily on the intimidation factor of being a big scary mobster with eyes everywhere and the ability to pay enough people willing to be paid to do terrible things that he can put his murders where his mouth is. Also like, very big into spectacle for that same reason - the eyes thing isn't just because he's crazy, it's because it's flashy and a big spectacle

> But absolutely weedy wet cat of a man, even Lia could probably beat him up if she wanted to
