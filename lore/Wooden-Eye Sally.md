Formerly Sarah Sands, Sally is a broken puppeteer and [[Annette-Marie DuPont]]'s [[Flock]] handler. Originally part of a family of entertainers, Sally lost her husband [[Robin Sands]] and their children [[Rantel Sands]] and [[Sadie Sands]].

Sally's face is deeply lined, her hair ash-blonde, but faded, mostly white. a cruel scar curves around the orbit of her left temple, in which a polished eye of walnut wood stares blindly through the three.

She grins, revealing a mix of teeth, real, wood, verdigris-coloured copper. Some appear to have been intricate cut from old pottery, traces of the blue patterned glaze still visible.

**Notes:**

- Has a pet magpie, "doncha know?"
- Possible crush on [[Anoster]].
- Lives under a bridge.
- Her son, Rob was executed for

> Folks say she used to be some famous puppeteer or some such nonsense. Now she does skits for a groat for the brats in the day and the drunks at night.” He chuckled unkindly. “She's pretty funny sometimes, mad as Dorshire Duke, though.”
>
> But Annette did not hear this last part, for she had wandered over, staring hard at the lined and grimy features, the clothes that clearly had once been of fine quality and cut, the familiar lettering on one edge of the cover of the make-shift booth... It was her!
>
> 'Wooden Eye' Sally indeed lived up to her name, for her left eye was missing and a ball of polished walnut wood replaced it.
>
> “The Show must, must go on, though! Just a few minutes my dear....” She returned to mumbling. “Just a few more... tell your friends, drunk or drinking, would you dear?”
>
> Annette could not help but pity the woman. Could this really be the great Sarah Strand? She did not know, nor did she know why she bothered to help, but help she did, rallying the clientelle of the holstelry to spare a coin for the Puppeteer and dragging them out from every shady hole in the smokey inn to witness the spectacle on the street.

> In between the crude humour and violence, the show was a surprisingly subtle satire, she thought. Though it mercilessly mocked the aristocracy, it also laid into the Commonwealth - a literal 'Potato king' puppet pronouncing wild and nonsensical proclamations as the burlesque unfolded. Annette couldn't help but laugh at the antics of the strange grotesque puppets on the miniature stage!

> It didn't take too long to track Sally down to her new home under a bridge, rudely decorated with a surprising array of carved, gilt wood, old costumes, puppets, tools and, most disturbingly, a dozen decaying marionettes hanging from their strings from the arch of the bridge itself. The old woman had not forgotten her, and she learned, through tortuous lateral conversation, that a man had paid her to use the story of her most recent puppet show. This was odd in and of itself, for she did not imagine any ordinary agitator or composer of popular songs would have the scruples to pay a mad old woman for the premise of her little play.
>
> “Oh they're good, good little birds, to be sure...” Sally smiled, knowingly. “You could visit their nest, if I give you wings...” Before Annette could further press her on what she meant, she had turned away and began to rummage in the pile of puppets and junk behind her. After a moment, she re-emerged with a half-masque, carved from wood and leather, half hag, half bird and who knew what else – the work of a madwoman, but strangely compelling, exactly like that described in the ballad.
