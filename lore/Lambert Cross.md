At night:

> A great wooden scaffold, three men high. Upon its various struts and hooks, a hundred lanterns hang, sending light out across the dark devastation of the Blow. Watchmen slouch at its base, keeping a wary eye across rubble and broken walls, always on the lookout for trouble crossing between districts.
