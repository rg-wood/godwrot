#encounter

[[The Sparrow]]'s latest play showing at [[The Mare]]; a saucy affair of gallant men and swooning maids. Popular with the wives and daughters of the noble houses. Competition for seats is fierce.

- Two noble women are making a scene, pulling at each others hair and fighting over a ticket reservation.
  - A crowd watches, placing bets.
- To reach the entrance before tickets sell out requires a ENDURANCE roll: 1 success means only standing tickets (4 copper) are available, 2 means balcony seats (1 silver) are also still available and 3+ means you pushed too hard and make a hostile random encounter (`dice: [[Chalk Quarter^sparks]]|Spark 1` `dice: [[Chalk Quarter^sparks]]|Spark 2`).
- The [[Red Swan]] is already seated on the opposite gallery when the party arrive.
  - She is accompanied by [[De Urwin]].
