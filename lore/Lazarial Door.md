#location

> An ancient door is set into the floor here, wrought of wood and iron. It is encrusted in swirling filth, dark crimson like scabbed blood. It stands a little ajar.

On closer inspection:

> Through the crack in the ajar door, a low groaning sound can be heard. Warm air beats from beyond. A set of stairs made of what appears to be scabbed blood leads down.

[[Lazarial Door]] is a portal to [[Hell]], opened by [[Lazarial]] before he disappeared from [[Creation]]. It stands a little ajar, having been opened by the breaking of the [[First Seal]].

Opening [[Lazarial Door]] requires the breaking of the [[Third Seal]], or some other powerful spell of Power Level 5.
