> A set of baroque jewellery made of onyx beads including an elaborate collar necklace, matching bracelets and filigreed earrings. The almost imperceptible sound of whispers can be heard around them, just too quiet to understand what is being said.

The Dimlit Regalia is a powerful artefact that gives its possessor [[Shadow Sorcery]]. The regalia was gifted to [[The Gloaming Queen]] by [[The Mother]] to keep [[🗡 Dismas Remade/The Bastard|The Bastard]] imprisoned in the [[Abyss]]. It's true power is to keep the [[Shadowside]] shut and prevent Her step-son from escaping his punishment.

It consists of:

- [[The Dimlit Necklace]]
- Two [[Dimlit bracelet]]s
- Two [[Dimlit earring]]s.

The Dimlit Regalia has since been separated, lost by [[The Gloaming Queen]] and acquired by others as follows:

- [[The Darkwater King]] kept the [[The Dimlit Necklace]] and a [[Dimlit bracelet]] from [[The Gloaming Banquet]].
- As part of a peace deal with [[The Gloaming Queen]], [[The Hierophant]] obtained a [[Dimlit earring]].
  - The [[Mad Bishop of Dismas]] holds the [[Dimlit earring]] in a vault somewhere in the [[🗡 Dismas Remade/Cathedrale Temporal]].
    - [[Nevala]] stole the [[Dimlit earring]] from the vault.
- [[The Merchant]] was looking for a [[Dimlit bracelet]] and a [[Dimlit earring]].
  - [[Lia]] found a [[Dimlit bracelet]] in a [[Kastenburg]] back alley. ==How did she find it?==
