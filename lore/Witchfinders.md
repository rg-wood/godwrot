#faction

**Leader:** [[Mad Bishop of Dismas]]
**Symbol:** Wide brimmed hats

While witchfinders traditionally punish witchcraft and heresy, they have broadened the definition of the blasphemous and become the <em>de facto</em> secret police of the [[Privy Council]]. Nominally under the command of the bishop, they are largely left to their own, brutal devices and self-organise around their shared fanaticism.

**Notes:**

- Hated by almost everybody in the city.
