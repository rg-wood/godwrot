#encounter

Unlike mortals, in the unlikely event a [[Spirit]] dies, the concept they represent also dies, disappearing from the [[Mortal Realm]] as though it never existed. Its conceptual remains appearing in the [[Abyss]] as a [[Kark]]: giant, skeletal remains.

By somehow bringing a [[Kark]] back to the [[Mortal Realm]], or back to life, the [[Spirit]] can be reborn and it's representing concept returns to creation.
