> When transcribing these events I often ponder, how deep does the hole go? We are yet to see its terminus, I fear.
>
> We draw back the curtains to find our players standing over the body of the Red Swan, darling of the city's night life, concubine to wealth and privilege. And, so it turns out, witch.
>
> One asks, what might be the ramifications of her mighty death? What might be the sentiment towards those who helped ushered her beyond?
>
> In other words, one might ask "is this good?"
>
> I feel the question doesn't warrant an answer, but let's us see if one is provided.
