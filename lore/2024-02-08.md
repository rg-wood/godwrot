#session

> Frivolous passersby, come close and listen. For a measly penny you can enter and watch our play.
>
> What, do you ask, is it about, exactly? Well, 'tis a strange sort of comedy. The playwright cannot exactly say what will happen, because the players themselves decide.
>
> "These must be well reasoned players," I hear you say? Why, no! They are a disastrous company.
>
> "Then what is the entertainment?" you exclaim, lacking in patience now.
>
> Why, 'tis the disaster itself.
>
> Watch as our players, having entered and exited a nunnery in the night (I weep to see your eyes roll) and ensnare yet another witch. She surrenders and we shall see what they make of that.
