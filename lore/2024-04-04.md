#session

> _We draw back our curtain on an assemblage of players, in assorted states of lucidity. Gathered around a table, breaking their fast with putrid food._
>
> _What do they discuss? Why, to make plans with a witch uncouth, to steal from a nunnery and abscond with a priceless relic._
>
> _Pray, our audience, I hear your tuts and heavy sighs, but have patience. Events may transpire to improve._
>
> _Hark now, let us draw close and listen..._

> _[[Madam Ermen]]_ sits at a corner of the table, silently crying and meekly eating a foul kipper.
