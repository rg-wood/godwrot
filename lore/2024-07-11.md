#session

> Let me tell it so: I was the son of The Father, but not The Mother, and _that_ was the first sin. The plain fishwives who worship at the Maternoster Shrines, and the dirty old men who fleck spittle from Temple lecterns: _they_ have it wrong.
>
> They say my sins were the first three sins: I stole the first thing, which begat my second sin: I told the first lie, which angered My Father and lead to my third (but not final) sin: I spoke the first curse.
>
> And so My Father turned from me, and The Mother cut off the hand I stole with, and threw me from creation. As I fell, I scrabbled at the Mortal Realm, tearing at its light and creating the first shadows, before I dropped into the endless emptiness beyond that light.
>
> So, when you hear them curse my name, remember it is they who lie. And I should know, being the god of lies myself.

> What is this, my dear audience? Who is this strange figure on the stage? He is no performer I recognise...

> The Bastard: Silence, wright!

> I...

> The Bastard: You really are an insufferable arse.

> But... but...
