Lord Roche is Chancellor of the [[Privy Council]] and the real power behind the [[Three Kings]]. A coarse man and a bully with a ruthless streak. He is stupid enough to think he can get the better of [[Hell]] and is gambling the soul of an entire country. It was he who negotiated the [[Riverhithe Accord]].

- Nasty cough
- Hoarse voice
- Boots always covered in mud
- Smells faintly of manure
- Fancies himself a farmer

1. Got into an argument with [[Cadfyre]].
2. Broke the [[Second Seal]].
