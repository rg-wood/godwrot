![[The Haunter.png]]

**ATTRIBUTES:** Strength 14, Agility 4, Wits 5, Empathy 2
**ARMOUR RATING:** 4
**MOVEMENT:** 1
**NETHERMENTAL:** Vulnerable to earthly materials such as metal, stone or soil. Naming it requires a successful LORE roll, and deals 10 Weapon Damage. This may only ever be done once against a particular nethermental.

> A great goat, taller than three men. It has a large, single bloodshot eye with a cross-like pupil.

The Haunter is a [[Nethermental]] who seeks to corrupt the [[Mortal Realm]] with the pure entropy of the [[Abyss]].

**Trickster.** The Haunter likes to offer a trivial riddle so it can "award" its [[Haunters Eye|eye]] to unwary victims. It knows the eye is dangerous to use and that it will likely open a [[Vortex]] into the [[Mortal Realm]] through which [[Nethermental]]s might escape the [[Abyss]].

**Omnivorous.** The Haunter can eat anything, permanently destroying it by chewing it into nothingness.

| 1   | **HIDEOUS BITE!** With a roar, the Haunter snaps at an adventurer, grinding its teeth into their flesh. Roll for the attack with 9 Base Dice and Weapon Damage 2 (slash wound). If the attack succeeds, the adventurer is pushed to NEAR distance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 2   | **UNEARTHLY SHRIEK!** The Haunter lets out a awful shriek that strikes all adventurers within NEAR range with a fear attack with 5 Base Dice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 3   | **CLOBBER!** The Haunter raises a hoof and stamps an adventurers to crush them. If the target fails a MOVE roll they are attacked with twelve Base Dice and Weapon Damage 1 (blunt force).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 4   | **DEVOURING ATTACK!** The Haunter attacks the adventurer with the highest Strength and tries to devour her. If the victim fails a MOVE roll (does not count as an action), she is attacked by 10 Base Dice (Weapon Damage 1, slash wound) and is devoured whole. Inside the Haunter, the adventurer suffers one point of damage every round as she is exposed to pure void. The adventurer can attack the Haunter from the inside, where the un-being has no armour. If the adventurer inflicts 4 points of damage or more on the Haunter from the inside, she successfully hacks her way out. |
| 5   | **SWEEPING CHARGE!** The Haunter bows its head and makes a charging attack that hits all adventurers within NEAR range. Roll for the attack with 7 Base Dice and Weapon Damage 1 (blunt force). If an attack hits, the victim is also thrown to the ground.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 6   | **THE VOID OPENS!** The Haunter dives, opening a [[Vortex]] to the [[Abyss]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
