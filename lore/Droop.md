- Seeks to become a [[Cult of the Bastard]] left hand and supplant Maude as leader of [[The Grapevine]].

**History:**

1. [[Droop]] blackmails [[Reynard Grenouille]].
2. [[Droop]] uses funds from his blackmail to buy weapons for his faction of [[The Grapevine]].
3. Formed an alliance with [[Raul the Sharp|Raul]] to overthrow [[Mother Maude|Maude]] (whom he plans to betray).
