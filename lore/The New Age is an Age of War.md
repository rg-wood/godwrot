For many the [[New Age]] bears a striking resemblance to old ones. New ideas threaten old powers and embolden new ones. The inevitable result is familiar to many: war!

Religious schisms, new, national borders and old, ethnic tensions divide the people anew. Brother takes arms against brother in cruel battle, made all the worse by new discoveries in explosives and firearms.

In the midst of this chaos, corruption thrives. While the old authorities are distracted, thieves band together, corrupt officials take bribes and hypocrites and demagogues prosper.
