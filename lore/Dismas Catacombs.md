#district

Beneath [[Dismas]] lies a network of sewers, tunnels, crypts, buried buildings and hidden hovels, known to the locals as the Catacombs.

**Architected.** The catacombs were constructed using the advanced architecture of the [[Old Empire]]. The walls are made of great, stone slabs, hewn in such as way as to make the tunnels perfectly circular. By what means this was achieved maybe lost to the ages.
