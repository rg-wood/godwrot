![[The Bastard.png|200]]

> A young man, handsomely dressed in black, with black hair cut into a mullet. His eyes burn a bright blue. His face is expressionless and beautiful, his skin deathly grey.
>
> Half his right-arm is missing, cut off in a straight line at the elbow. Dark matter pours from the wound, separating into shadowy threads that squirm obscenely as they disappear into the surrounding darkness.

The Bastard is the trickster god of shadows, luck and thieves. He is the illegitimate son of [[The Father]], crippled and banished for his crimes against creation.

- **Crippled.** [[Shadowstuff]] leaks from the open wound of his severed right arm.
- **Shadow god.** All shadows are his shrine. He commands the [[Shade]]s.
- **God of Thieves.** Worshipped by thieves through the [[Cult of the Bastard]].
- **Trickster.** Seeks to undermine the authority of the [[New Gods]], whom he fears.
- **Prisoner.** Trapped in the [[Abyss]], where he wiles away eternity counting [[The Bastard's Count]].

He seeks an escape from the [[Abyss]], and has a number of plans:

- [ ] Break the [[Third Seal]] just enough to create a never-ending night and destroy the [[Shadowside]].
- [ ] Or, steal and destroy the [[The Dimlit Regalia]] to tear down the wall between the [[Mortal Realm]].

## History

> I was the son of The Father, but not The Mother, and that was the first sin. The plain fishwives who worship at the Maternoster Shrines, and the dirty old men who fleck spittle from Temple lecterns: they have it wrong.
>
> They say my sins were the first three: I stole the first thing, which begat my second sin: I told the first lie, which angered My Father and lead to my third (but not final) sin: I spoke the first curse.
>
> And so My Father turned from me, and The Mother cut off the hand I stole with, and threw me from creation. As I fell, I scrabbled at the Mortal Realm, tearing at its light and creating the first shadows, before I dropped into the vast emptiness beyond.
