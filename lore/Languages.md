Common fantasy languages like Elvish do not exist in the Land. Instead, the following languages are available to characters:

- **_Common._** The trade tongue and international lingua franca, descended from Imperial.
- **_Imperial._** The dead language of the Old Empire, largely forgotten except in academic circles.
- **_The Half Tongue._** A pidgin language, with words from Common and the forgotten language of the pagans.
- **_Enochian._** The esoteric language of the angels, popular in occult circles.
- **_Witch's Tongue_.** A blasphemous language is said to be taught by demons to their infernal followers.
- **_Sermon Form._** A coded dialect used by ecclesiastical scholars. It has been largely forgotten, except to conceal heretical works. Written only.
