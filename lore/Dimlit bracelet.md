![[Dimlit bracelet.jpg|200]]

> A gleaming onyx bracelet that seems to whisper, as though begging someone to wear it.

Wearing the bracelet gives you the ability to use [[Shadow Sorcery]]. It is cursed and, once worn, it cannot be removed without completely severing the arm.

While worn it slowly corrupts the wearer, leaking black effluvia where it cuts into flesh. Magical mishaps are a result of this corruption, and should be flavoured appropriately.

- The dimlit bracelet is but one of a pair, and is part of a more powerful artefact [[The Dimlit Regalia]].
- According to [[Maeg]] and [[Soudec]] one way to destroy the bracelet is command the [[Shade]]s to eat its bearer, destroying it in the process.
