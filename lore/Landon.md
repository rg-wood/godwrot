_He/him_ #pc

**Player:** Rain

Landon von Black is an alchemist who escaped from the village of [[Aureum]] so that he might come to [[Dismas]] to find [[Veronica Dan]] and expand his knowledge of alchemy. He is a short man, with long, black hair. He wears a travel cape with two iron bracelets on each wrist.

Landon has only ever read Veronica's works on alchemy, yet has become infatuated with her.

When we first meet Landon he is working for [[Flock]], delivering a large amount of gold to the party for a sensitive negotiation.

**Notes:**

- Under the influence of [[Seranese Wine]].
