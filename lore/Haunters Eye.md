> A fleshy, bloodshot eye the size of a man's head, with a cross-shaped iris.

This eye belongs to the [[Haunter]], and it can be taken from its dead body or given willingly.

## Effects

When directed, anything caught in the gaze of the eye withers, ages, or decays depending on what it is – buildings, food and living creatures are all affected. Each round in the direct gaze of the eye within NEAR range, the object ages one year.

## Drawback

The eye is dangerously unstable, and each time it's used there is a 1-in-6 (`dice:1d6`) chance it will explode, opening a [[Vortex]] for 3d6 (`dice: 3d6`) minutes. The eye then returns to the [[Haunter]].
