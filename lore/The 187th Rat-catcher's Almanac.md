This decaying tome appears to be a simple trade guide for rat-catchers. A careful study will reveal a detailed report on ratfolk hidden within. If you discover this you can then reference this book whenever you make an LORE roll to investigate the ratfolk.

"Damage" to the almanac represents the diminishing returns on reading it. When the item is broken, you have learned everything you can from the almanac and it is useless.

This book is notorious amongst the [[Vermus]] and they will do anything to locate and destroy copies.
