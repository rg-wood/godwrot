#location

This ramshackle building hangs from the ceiling of [[Little Covet]]. It has held for many years, but occasionally shakes a little.

- The party are roomed here as part of the [[Negotiation between the Flock and Creed]].
- [[Maisey]] keeps her thieves' tools hidden here.

## Main Room

Two impressive tables sit here, mismatched sizes, surrounded by a collection of mismatched chairs, where one might sit to eat, or perhaps even plot.

In one corner there is a small stove, upon which victuals might be cooked.
