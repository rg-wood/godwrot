The Deadside is the mirror realm of the dead that lies beneath the world of the living. The mortal world can always been seen by looking up. The ground is covered in dust, and bones and mementos that fall from above.

- The dust is actually the remain of ghosts who lingered too long in the Deadside and completely disintegrated.
- Consuming bones and mementos staves off this decay.
- Stairs lead down through the [[Abyss]] to [[Hell]].
- Stairs lead back up to the living world are guarded by [[Psychopomps]].
