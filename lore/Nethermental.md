Nethermentals are the un-beings that swim in the [[Abyss]], creatures of the void who swim in oblivion.

- **Un-beings.** Nethermentals are nameless creatures who seek to obliterate matter, living things, and especially ideas. For this reason, being named causes them great harm.
- **Abhor Creation.** Nethermentals abhor the [[Mortal Realm]], and are vulnerable earthly materials such as soil or metal.
