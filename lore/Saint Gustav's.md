#location

> Pyres in various states of conflagration surround this ruined chapel.

Within:

> The walls of this chapel still stand, but the roof and floor are gone, exposing the crypts below and forming a pit like structure.
>
> Witchfinders crawl up and down the perilous stone stairs, preparing for their witch hunts or ferrying prisoners to and from the oubliettes below. Despite the industrious work, the air is strangely quiet.

The [[Witchfinders]] in [[South Dismas]] are quartered in the shelled remains of Saint Gustav's Chapel, ruined by Commonwealth gunpowder during the [[Siege of Dismas]].

**Notes:**

- The unearthed masonry of the elaborate crypt offers bedchambers, arsenals and oubliettes for the witchfinder army.
- Prisoners awaiting judgement are left in cramped, horizontal oubliettes. Chambers that once interred the dead but now cramp heretics so tightly they cannot move at all, with only their head visible.
- Blasphemers and witches are burned outside on a regular basis, at all hours.

## Chancel Chair

> The chancel has somehow remained intact, creating an unreachable and perilous perch over the rest of the chapel. The desiccated skeleton of a witchfinder sits in a large, wooden chair glumly watching over the proceedings below.

The "Witchfinder General" was a venerable witchfinder who died in the pursuit of the wicked and was immortalised by having his remains left here, a reminder to all witchfinders that faith wins the day.

## Sanctioned Vault

> A great iron door buried in the masonry of the crypt.

Lying beneath the crypt a smaller door sits behind a smaller door sits behind a great iron door. Behind that lies the secret vault known only as "Sanctioned Vault" or just the "Sanction." It is used to store the blasphemous magical artefacts or mystical lore the witchfinders acquire as part of their investigations. It is kept locked at all times, and fanatical guards stand sentry around the clock.
