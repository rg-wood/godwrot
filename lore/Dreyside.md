![[Dreyside.png]]

Dreyside was a village on the outskirts of [[Dismas]] that was drowned by a change in tides of the [[River Hy]]. All that is left are the roofs and spires still poking out of the river waters.

Anyone risking the swim can recover the [[Dreyside Parish Ledgers]] from the sunken temple here.

**History:**

1. The last parson of the village, [[Mad Bishop of Dismas|Parson Angelo]], was notorious for demanding donations.
2. [[Mad Bishop of Dismas|Parson Angelo]] was arrested for fraud.
3. Unpaid debts left the village in poverty.
4. Without funds to pay for repairs the river banks failed.
