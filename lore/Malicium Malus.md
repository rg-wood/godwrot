**Gear:** 5

> This long and narrow book is wrapped in bleached white leather. Within are written are pages and pages of musical notes for hymns.

This infamous tome contains a list of the true names of the many demons of [[Hell]], disguised as a series of hymns. Anyone with any knowledge of music will realise the hymns are discordant rubbish. The notes of the hymns are actually a cipher that can be deciphered by anyone who can read [[🗡 Dismas Remade/Languages|Enochian]].

It is typically given to emissaries of [[Hell]] as a show of diplomatic trust.

It is trapped with a [[Cursed Note]].

## Effects

The gear dice for Malicium Malus can be used for any LORE check related to demons or [[Hell]], provided the reader can understand the cipher.

Anyone performing one of the malformed hymns from the book is granted a +2 modifier to all PERSUASION checks related to haggling or purchasing for the next quarter.

A [[Demon]] must obey anyone possessing its true name. Furthermore, demons cannot touch or directly or indirectly damage the Malicium Malus.

## Drawbacks

[[Demon]]s are understandably keen to find and destroy this item, and are violently hostile to anyone possessing it who isn't an emissary to [[Hell]].
