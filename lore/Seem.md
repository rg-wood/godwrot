> This woman wears a bedraggled bone white gown, precisely the same shade of flesh. Her unnaturally smooth skin is dotted with dew-like drops of water and is covered in almost imperceptible fuzz.
>
> The train of her dress is stained with dark waters, sending trail of black stains up the fabric and through veins of her skin.

> "A warning: careful what you say. In this place, words are forever."

Seem is the ancient witch of the [[Marches]], sorceress of the [[Victus and Lash|White]], [[Archfey]] and last of the [[March Witches]]. Graceful, commanding and utterly alien.

- **Oath Bound.** To gain her power Seem has sworn many oaths to the [[Old Gods]] and must abide by many prohibitions, including:
  - She cannot speak a lie.
  - She cannot leave the [[Marches]].
- **Lonely.** Seem has lived alone for centuries in her barrow in the [[Marches]].
  - With only her newt familiar for company.
- **Imperious.** Seem has lived for centuries and has nothing but contempt for mortals.
