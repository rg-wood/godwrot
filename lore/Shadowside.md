#plane

The Shadowside is a plane of darkness that coexists alongside the [[Mortal Realm]], from which shadows are drawn. It is inhabited by the [[Shade]]s who go about, literally shadowing the living or wandering aimlessly.

- **Darklight.** Creatures can see through darkness as thought it were light here. Similarly, light is blinding and obscures as darkness would in the [[Mortal Realm]].
- **Shadowhome.** [[Shadow Sorcery]] does not work in the [[Shadowside]].
