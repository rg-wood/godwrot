#location

This ramshackle inn stands six floors tall, towering over the smaller (and smarter) merchant houses in this neighbourhood. It is a jumble of turrets, lead-lined windows and precarious, external stairs. Floors pile on top of each other, each larger than the one below. Topped by a crown of haphazard gables, eaves and smoking chimney stacks. The whole structure seems to totter under its own weight.

Standing on the portico over the narrow entrance door is the head of a dragon, carved from wood. If it was once green it is no more, but it is impressive, nonetheless.

The entrance leads to a low-ceilinged bar filled with tables, nooks, alcoves, secluded tables and the sound of murmuring conversation. Several wooden staircases lead up and down, from which the sound of more clinking glasses and low conversation can be heard.

In the flickering candlelight merchants from across the Known World swap gossip. A pair of Southron merchants discuss trade deals sternly in one corner. A group of Quadrathi silver traders murmur to each other while swigging cups of wine in another. And what appears to be a Nebalese flesh-monger nibbles at platters of sweet cakes while watching the room carefully.
