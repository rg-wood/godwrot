An ornate silver compact mirror, that opens by means of a clasp in the shape of a swan. Ever so slightly tarnished. It belonged to the [[Red Swan]] and she used it as grimoire and ingredient for her mirror-based witchcraft. It was a given to her by [[Medai]], as part of a deal to serve [[Hell]] in exchange for her revenge against [[King Beyr]].

### Effects

By using the mirror to peer into the other worlds, it can be used as an ingredient in any Witchcraft spell.

The bearer can also speak through the compact to another mirror any distance away. If the target is near a mirror, speaking their name opens a two way communication. Conversely, someone can speak the bearers name into any mirror and open communication through the compact.

Only one such communication is allowed at a time.

Lastly, this power can be used to speak to any creature inhabiting the [[Dismas Deadside|Dismas Deadside]], [[🗡 Dismas Remade/Feyside|Feyside]], [[Shadowside]], [[Abyss]] or [[Hell]].

### Drawbacks

Using the compact can draw the attention of spirits, in particular the demon [[Medai]]. When you use the glass make a successful LORE roll, or attract the attention of a random spirit. There is a 2-in-6 (`dice: 1d6`) chance this is Medai.

The drawbacks can be avoided by making some kind of deal with [[Medai]].
