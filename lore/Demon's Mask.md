_This hellish mask has a storied history of misfortune and woe. Many have worn it, seeking to use its power to oppose Hell. Of those, most have eventually fallen under the sway of the hellish powers, themselves. To see the true form of a demon is see sin itself, naked in all its glory. And what is a demon if not a being who understands the true value of wickedness?_

## Appearance

An elaborate, wooden demon mask, lacquered deep blue. It is decorated with filigree and gold leaf.

## Effects

Other than the obvious benefits and drawbacks to wearing a mask, the demon's mask allows the wearer to see the true form of a [[Demon]]. Demon's can disguise themselves through illusions, or possess people and objects. These illusions have no effect upon you and a possessed object or person appears as a mix of moral features and demonic. For example, a possessed child might appear as a winged imp.

Conversely, the wearer appears to be a demon to other demons, and they will treat them (for better or worse) as one of their own.

The mask gives the wearer a D10 Artifact Die that can used on SCOUTING rolls to detect the presence of hellish forces (such as demons or [[Balefire]]). The wearer can also roll a D10 Artifact Die to reduce any damage from fire and demon magic. Each success reduces the damage by 1. You cannot push this roll. Additionally, the wearer is immune to [[Balefire]].
