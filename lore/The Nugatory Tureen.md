The Nugatory Tureen (or simply "The Nugatory") is a cat house catering to the new class of wealthy mercenaries supporting the [[Mandatory Forces]]. It hides down a side alley, the entrance for which can be found under it's sign: two cats fornicating on a rooftop.

- The sex workers here are noted for the (fake) silver jewellery they wear.
