#mission

The party must retrieve a copy of the [[De Mysteria Ignis]] from [[Sister Gratitude]] before the [[Black Hand]]. It is key to stopping [[The Marriage Phlegm and Sanguine]].

The [[Witchfinders]] are also looking for [[De Mysteria Ignis]] so that it maybe destroyed, and are even willing to cooperate with heretics (i.e. the party).
