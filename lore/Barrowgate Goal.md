> This large gate is adorned with frescoes of skeletons, piled on top of each.

Barrowgate was one of the original entrances to the old city, mainly used to transport the city's dead to [[Cemetery Hill]]. Now it is the only gate into the [[Inner City]]. A prison has been built over the gatehouse.

- Lengthy queues for entrance to the [[Chalk Quarter]] (`dice: 2d4` hours) line down [[Gutter Street]].
- Security is high and those seeking entrance must have **papers**, **badge of authority** or bear the **heraldry** of a noble house.
- Prisoners jeer and beg at passersby.
- Sound of clanking chains and irons doors can be heard at night.
