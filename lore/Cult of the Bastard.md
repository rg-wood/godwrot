#faction

The Cult of the Bastard is the forgotten worship of [[🗡 Dismas Remade/The Bastard|The Bastard]]. Once, every [[Thieves' Council of Dismas|Thieves' Council of Dismas]] had a priest, a so-called "left-hand", who interpreted [[Book of Fingers]], looked after those too weak to thieve, and made sure The Bastard got his dues: a token share of all ill-gotten gains.

**History:**

1. The Cult was ruthlessly expunged by the [[Thieves' Council of Dismas|Thieves' Council of Dismas]] Night Kings and Queens because:
   1. The Cult tithes were too high.
   2. The Cult challenged their power.
2. Fuelled by the ascendancy of [[The Grapevine]], the cult started a holy crusade against the Council.

## Edicts

The Bastard asks little of his flock, and his only edicts are that:

- **All may hide in the Bastard's shadow.** All are welcome to the Bastard's protection, and the Cult may not turn anyone away, provided...
- **The Bastard must have his dues.** All thieves must tithe a 13th of their ill-gotten gains to the Cult.
- **Fortune favours those who pay their dues.** The Bastard sends good luck to those who seize the moment for themselves.

Additionally, these aphorisms are commonly espoused by left-hands:

- **The Bastard keeps to his, while the Father looks for his own.** The Cult does not get involved in affairs out of the shadows, that is the politics of the non-criminal world.
- **Trust no one before the Bastard.** To the Cult crime is sacrament, and lies are prayers. The Bastard smiles on those who break their oaths.

## Left-Hands

The Cult of the Bastard has no organisation to speak of. Left-hands represent His word, and acolytes frequently assemble around them, but this always an informal arrangement.

As always, the Bastard must have his dues, and the wages of service as a left-hand are high: all left-hands must sacrifice some part of their flesh, whether that is eyes, limb or something else. A prospective left-hand must cut something from their own body and throw it to the shadows to curry His favour.
