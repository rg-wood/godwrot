[[Sister Persistence]]'s well thumbed cope of the [[Dictum]] heavily annotated with the [[Plutonus doctrine]] in [[Sermon form]]. Persistence kept copious notes on the [[Second Seal]] and other, apocalyptic subjects.

It's contents include:

- References the [[Thorn Library]] obliquely.
- A rough map of the of [[Temple of Old Smell]] with detailed locations of all the statues there and in the nearby area.

**History:**

1. Its cover was marked with the sign of the [[Black Hand]] by [[The Countess]].
2. [[Sister Persistence]] gave it to [[Red]] as she was dying.
