#session

**Chapter:** [[Roots]]

> Dear audience, welcome back from our brief interlude. I see thou have availed thyselves of the sugared herrings and mice napes.
>
> I shall recap, last we observed two young waifs, whispering through their needlework.
>
> "Reynard Gernouille," the first says, "I swear you not, that jacket he wore tonight was the twin of one I saw him in but last summer!"
>
> The other pretends shock. "A mistake, of course."
>
> The first fans herself extravagantly. "You are sweet, so sweet, dearest. Like the morning dew. I'd wager the Du Pont's holdings might be in peril."
>
> The other gasps dramatically.
>
> And so on, and so forth.
>
> What wanton gossips, the Father would despair.
>
> Besides, let us observe what befalls our twin catastrophes next.
