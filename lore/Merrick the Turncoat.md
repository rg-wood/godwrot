> Turn is a lean man, with sharp features and a notably large nose. He wears a leather long coat, far too big for his scrawny frame, covered in patches and patchwork threads from years of repair. An angry looking 'L' has been burned into the flesh of his right cheek.

Merrick, sometimes known as Turncoat, or just Turn, was a [[Company of the Black Griffin|Griffin Company]] mercenary who was captured when the [[Commonwealth Army]] liberated [[Nunstable]] from the [[Mandatory Forces]].

Turn was always a judicious fellow, but his stint as a prisoner of war has made him even more cautious. He counts every penny he spends in a small ledger he jealously keeps to himself, and which he hides somewhere in the pockets of his voluminous jacket. He saves whatever he can so he can keep moving, lest [[New Commonwealth]] justice catch up with him.

- Rasping voice from pipe smoking habit.
- Branded and wanted as a war criminal by the [[New Commonwealth]].
- It is generally agreed that Merrick turned traitor when he was captured by the [[Commonwealth Army]], which would explain his successful "escape", and his nickname.
- Not only has Turn heard the tales of rat men lurking in the catacombs of Dismas, he's actually seen them, or so he claims. He is obsessed with convincing others that the ratfolk are real, and that they are cutting deals with shadowy cabals in Dismas (in this particular case, [[The Grapevine]]'s alliance with the ratfolk).
- Having had a taste of the supernatural, Turn asks himself, if rat men exist, what else might lurk in the shadows? He is methodically looking for answers and noting what he finds in his ledger.
- Somewhere, out there, [[Justice Bellows]] searches for Turn. Only he knows what Turn _really_ did, and he'll doggedly follow the trail until he winkles him out. When he does, the truth of Turn's escape will be revealed.
- Turn owes money to [[Munder's Hounds]] and has yet to repay them. It's only a matter of time before one of [[Munder]]'s stray dogs sniffs him out.
