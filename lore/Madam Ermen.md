![[Madam Ermen.png|200]]

**Archetype:** Kitty from _Ghosts_

> This striking woman stands tall and is dressed impeccably in a brocade dress of tasteful style. The clear lines of her face give her a haughty impression, with the ghost of a coy smile playing on her perfect lips.

Madan Ermen is a widow, who was once a great beauty whose likeness was carved into the mastheads of many a ship.

- **Damned.** Ermen has cut a deal with [[Hell]] to keep her youthful appearance.
  - Her reflection appears old and withered.
  - Serves and eats rotten food, doesn't seem to notice.
- **Forgotten.** All her friends are long dead and no one remembers who she was anymore.
- **Lonely and Insecure.** Demands the attention of all visitors to her house.
- **Tea.** Always offers a cup of tea.
