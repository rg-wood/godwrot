#district

> Here the buildings become strange: doors and windows stand open. Here and there, good houses, clean and well-kept, seemingly stand empty. Where are their inhabitants? The streets are silent. No strays prowl. No beggars call for alms. All is still.

This district is home to the various merchants, cook, bakers and others who supply the food markets in the city, in places like [[Gross Market]].

There's something wrong in [[Small Grave]]. The [[Saint]]s creep from [[Old Smell]] at night, slowly emptying the district, randomly going from door-to-door and killing the inhabitants. Those who can leave, have. Those who can't, hide in their own houses at night, dreading that knock at their door.

- **Warded:** Unbeknownst to the inhabitants, [[Small Grave]] is surrounded by a ring of salt crystal, that keeps the evil forces within [[Old Smell|Old Smell Chapel]] contained.
