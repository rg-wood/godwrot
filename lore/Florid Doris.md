> A ruddy girl with a great crown of curly, black hair, tied up with a red scarf.

Seamstress by day, singer and mummer by night, Floris is a hopeless romantic with a warm sense of humour. Her smile is missing a few teeth, but most people don't notice for all her warmth.

She dreams of fame and fortune, and her irrepressible spirit is contagious.

- In love with [[De Urwin]], and flush with joy.
- Plots to steal Urwin from the [[Red Swan]].
- Has recently given up her day job.
  - She is just a few days away from destitution.
- Quietly sings to herself.
