> What is this sound? As our curtain draws, nary a muttering from the front row, nary a cough or snort.

> Dearest audience, are you in suspense? Do your lips part with baited breath? Does your heart stir? What of Irsist? Will Lia ever return from the shadowside?
>
> I'll leave you in suspense no more, let us see what befalls us in the Court of the Shadow King.
