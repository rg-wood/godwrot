#npc

> A short woman, with an unhealthy pallor. Her lips are pursed, and her eyes tired. She has a bandage wrapped around her head, covering her nose.

Veronica Dan is actually one person separated into two homunculi clones, Veron and Nadici, when they attempted and failed to create the [[Adjunctive Verboten]].

- [ ] ~~Offers [[Landon]] immortality if he'll secretly side with them.~~

* **Addicted.** Desperate to find a uncorrupted formula for the [[Adjunctive Verboten]] to reunite themselves.
* **Sickened.** They have cut a deal with [[Hell]] to help with [[The Marriage Phlegm and Sanguine]] in exchange for access to [[De Mysteria Ignis]] after the ceremony is complete.
* **Suspicious.** [[The White Alchemist]] considers them anathema and wants them dead.
