The DuPonts are a noble house, displaced from their ancestral homes in [[Dorshire]] by the [[Commoner Revolution]]. They own numerous properties in [[Dismas]], to which they have retreated.

As Chief Porter – Keeper of Tolls and Tariffs - the DuPonts were responsible for every bridge, lock and sally port, each turnpike and town-gate, including the [[Bridge of Shakes]]. [[Wooden-Eye Sally]].
