![[Lia.png|250]]

**Lia** is a [[Shadow Sorcery|shadow sorcerer]] and ex-[[Kastenburg]] assassin. Short and slight, she dresses in layers of baggy clothing that hide her missing left hand, and a threadbare hood that hides her delicate and youthful face. Her eyes are dark and shadowed, and her nose is ever-so-slightly crooked.

Her right wrist is wrapped in a linen bandage that leaks a strange, black fluid, and conceals a [[Dimlit bracelet]], magically fastened to her wrist. It allows her to speak with the shadows, parley with them and sometimes even command them, but she can't remove it.

**Notes:**

- Seeks safety and protection from [[Red]].
