A note from [[Sister Naive|The Vestal]] to [[Red Swan|The Concubine]] with the following missive written therein:

> I've tried the glass countless times and I cannot acquire your attention. They're already suspicious, and must think me a proper strumpet mooning at my reflection all day. You really must put your new toy down, our masters grow impatient. Find me in the thorn maze at the strike of midnight, we have much to discuss.

The back of the note is marked with a black handprint, the sign of the [[Black Hand]]
