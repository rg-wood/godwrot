**Chapter:** [[Roots]]

> _We draw our curtain back 'pon our players, weary yet, uncannily, victorious. 'Tis been a long-drawn day since their 'scape, spent in rest, a-scavenging foods and contemplating the rush of odd events._
>
> _Yet, their thoughts return and return to their responsibilities. Where might this leave the Flock. What of that? What of them?_
>
> _So, contact with agents of the New Commonwealth, invitation is arranged. The party of fools finds themselves at The Mare once more, standing in the empty auditorium, while the Sparrow rehearses._
