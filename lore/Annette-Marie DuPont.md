> "Can I help you? Wanna game perhaps?"

Scion of the [[DuPont Duchy]] and exile from [[Dorshire]]. Annette is secretly the notorious Commonwealth agent, Ragged Annis.

Annette dresses in simple clothes, a blouse and rude weskit, breeches, and otherwise unremarkable clothes, but for the feather in her cap, an ostentatious golden pheasant's plume. Her features aren't easy to discern, streaked as they are with filth.

- Her brother is feckless.
- Her father is source faced.
- Her mother is neurotic.

1. Married to [[Reynard Grenouille]].
2. Made famous by the infamous play, [[The Runn of Ragged Annis]].
3. Kidnapped by [[Red Swan]].
