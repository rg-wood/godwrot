#location

This rude and crowded tavern is popular with [[New Commonwealth]] sympathisers. Its young but balding barkeep runs several hidden rooms for plotting.

Birds of any kind are not allowed and a sign outside reads:

> FOWL ARE NOT PERMITTED
> BY ORDER OF THE PUBLICAN
> NO CHICKENS, DUCKS, AND SO FORFH

1. [[Ragged Annis]] favourite drinking hole.
