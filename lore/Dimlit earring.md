> A gleaming black stone hangs from a onyx chain, whispering as though begging someone to wear it.

Wearing the earring gives you the ability to use [[Shadow Sorcery]]. It is cursed and, once worn, it cannot be removed without completely damaging the ear.

While worn it slowly corrupts the wearer, leaking black effluvia where it cuts into flesh. Magical mishaps are a result of this corruption, and should be flavoured appropriately.

- The [[Dimlit earring]] is but one of a pair, and is part of a more powerful artefact [[The Dimlit Regalia]].
