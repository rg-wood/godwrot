| Ric (GM)  | At that moment, the door to the shop crashes open and Anoster stumbles in, Sally cradled in his bear arms. |
| Ric (GM)  | Sally's face is a mask of red and she seems unusually quiet.                                               |
| Anoster   | They're onto us!                                                                                           |
