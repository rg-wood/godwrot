> Endless darkness engulfs you. Narrow pillars of rough-hewn stone rise from the pitch black beneath you. They form a precarious path of stepping stones that slowly descend into the emptiness beyond.

[[Abyss]] is the void that separates the [[Shadowside]] (and indirectly the [[Mortal Realm]]) from the heavens, [[Hell]] and other planes of existence.

**Soothing.** [[Abyss]] is still and without sensation. It is silent, its air neither warm nor cold, creating an eerily soothing effect. It would be so easy to simply lie down in its embrace and sleep forever.

**Spiritual Graveyard.** [[Abyss]] is littered with the dead remains of ideas, memories and spirits that have disappeared from creation, appearing as [[Kark]]s. If you die in [[Abyss]], the memory you ever existed is wiped from creation.

**Interstitial.** [[Abyss]] is a gulf between planes, and it is criss-crossed with paths to and from them, particularly the various [[Astral Staircase]]s. However, creation is old, and many paths have submitted to the growing hunger of the Abyss and are broken, now leading nowhere.

## Journeys in [[Abyss]]

==[Too easy compared to the regular journey rules]==

Time and distance are unmoored from reason and measure in [[Abyss]]. The are no maps or roads. Instead, travellers must descend its depths ("down" is the best analogy for direction within [[Abyss]]) by intuition and occult knowledge. When you descend into [[Abyss]], you should do so with some destination in mind. You must successfully navigate a number of sink points - abstract measures of conceptual distance - to reach a particular destination, as defined by the following table:

| Destination      | Sink points |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| Heaven           | 20          |
| [[Hell]]         | 4           |
| [[Kark]]         | 4           |
| Minor [[God]]    | 8           |
| [[Mirror Realm]] | 6           |
| [[Nethermental]] | 4           |

Regardless of the number of sink points between destinations, each journey in [[Abyss]] randomly takes 1d6 quarters.

### Descend

Every time you attempt to descend to a new sink point you must make a LORE roll. Success means you reach the new sink point, or you reach your destination if you've successfully covered all the sink points towards it.

On a failure, you are beset by a mishap between sink points. Roll on the mishap table below. If you survive this mishap, you then reach the next sink point.

A sink point may or may not have a landmark. Roll on the landmark table to determine what, if anything, you find there.

### Ascend

Turning back from [[Abyss]] is easier that descending into its depths. To ascend you must traverse the same number of sink points that you descended, but each time you ascend you may cross two sink points at a time. Otherwise, ascending works the same as descending.

### Rest

Resting is not easy in [[Abyss]]. Pausing allows the void to gnaw at your soul. To successfully rest you must make an Empathy roll. If you fail, whatever benefit you might've gained from resting is undone by the sheer despair of [[Abyss]].
